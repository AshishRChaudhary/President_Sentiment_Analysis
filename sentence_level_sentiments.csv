"He is to them the representative  and typical American, the man who best embodies the political ideals of  the nation.",POSITIVE,0.9994,Lincoln
"He is typical in the fact that he sprang from the masses of  the people, that he remained through his whole career a man of the  people, that his chief desire was to be in accord with the beliefs and  wishes of the people, that he never failed to trust in the people and to  rely on their support.",POSITIVE,0.9884,Lincoln
Every native American knows his life and his  speeches.,POSITIVE,0.9968,Lincoln
His anecdotes and witticisms have passed into the thought and  the conversation of the whole nation as those of no other statesman have  done.,POSITIVE,0.9987,Lincoln
"He belongs, however, not only to the United States, but to the whole of  civilized mankind.",POSITIVE,0.9852,Lincoln
"It is no exaggeration to say that he has, within the  last thirty years, grown to be a conspicuous figure in the history of  the modern world.",POSITIVE,0.9997,Lincoln
"Without him, the course of events not only in the  Western hemisphere but in Europe also would have been different, for he  was called to guide at the greatest crisis of its fate a State already  mighty, and now far more mighty than in his days, and the guidance he  gave has affected the march of events ever since.",POSITIVE,0.998,Lincoln
A life and a character  such as his ought to be known to and comprehended by Europeans as well  as by Americans.,POSITIVE,0.9946,Lincoln
"Among Europeans, it is especially Englishmen who ought  to appreciate him and understand the significance of his life, for he  came of an English stock, he spoke the English tongue, his action told  upon the progress of events and the shaping of opinion in all British  communities everywhere more than it has done upon any other nation  outside America itself.",POSITIVE,0.9959,Lincoln
This collection of Lincoln's speeches seeks to make him known by  his words as readers of history know him by his deeds.,POSITIVE,0.9896,Lincoln
"In  popularly-governed countries the great statesman is almost of necessity  an orator, though his eminence as a speaker may be no true measure  either of his momentary power or of his permanent fame, for wisdom,  courage and tact bear little direct relation to the gift for speech.",POSITIVE,0.9946,Lincoln
"But  whether that gift be present in greater or in lesser degree, the  character and ideas of a statesman are best studied through his own  words.",POSITIVE,0.9382,Lincoln
"This is particularly true of Lincoln, because he was not what may  be called a professional orator.",NEGATIVE,0.6572,Lincoln
"There have been famous orators whose  speeches we may read for the beauty of their language or for the wealth  of ideas they contain, with comparatively little regard to the  circumstances of time and place that led to their being delivered.",POSITIVE,0.9711,Lincoln
Lincoln is not one of these.,NEGATIVE,0.8497,Lincoln
His speeches need to be studied in close  relation to the occasions which called them forth.,NEGATIVE,0.8661,Lincoln
They are not  philosophical lucubrations or brilliant displays of rhetoric.,NEGATIVE,0.9959,Lincoln
They are a  part of his life.,POSITIVE,0.9983,Lincoln
"They are the expression of his convictions, and derive  no small part of their weight and dignity from the fact that they deal  with grave and urgent questions, and express the spirit in which he  approached those questions.",POSITIVE,0.9999,Lincoln
"Few great characters stand out so clearly  revealed by their words, whether spoken or written, as he does.",POSITIVE,0.9995,Lincoln
Accordingly Lincoln's discourses are not like those of nearly all the  men whose eloquence has won them fame.,NEGATIVE,0.9956,Lincoln
"When we think of such men as  Pericles, Demosthenes, Æschines, Cicero, Hortensius, Burke, Sheridan,  Erskine, Canning, Webster, Gladstone, Bright, Massillon, Vergniaud,  Castelar, we think of exuberance of ideas or of phrases, of a command of  appropriate similes or metaphors, of the gifts of invention and of  exposition, of imaginative flights, or outbursts of passion fit to stir  and rouse an audience to like passion.",POSITIVE,0.9994,Lincoln
"We think of the orator as gifted  with a powerful or finely-modulated voice, an imposing presence, a  graceful delivery.",POSITIVE,0.9989,Lincoln
"Or if—remembering that Lincoln was by profession a  lawyer and practised until he became President of the United States—we  think of the special gifts which mark the forensic orator, we should  expect to find a man full of ingenuity and subtlety, one dexterous in  handling his case in such wise as to please and capture the judge or the  jury whom he addresses, one skilled in those rhetorical devices and  strokes of art which can be used, when need be, to engage the listener's  feelings and distract his mind from the real merits of the issue.",POSITIVE,0.9999,Lincoln
Of all this kind of talent there was in Lincoln but little.,NEGATIVE,0.7296,Lincoln
"He was not  an artful pleader; indeed, it was said of him that he could argue well  only those cases in the justice of which he personally believed, and was  unable to make the worse appear the better reason.",NEGATIVE,0.9952,Lincoln
For most of the  qualities which the world admires in Cicero or in Burke we should look  in vain in Lincoln's speeches.,POSITIVE,0.6397,Lincoln
"They are not fine pieces of exquisite  diction, fit to be declaimed as school exercises or set before students  as models of composition.",NEGATIVE,0.9978,Lincoln
"What, then, are their merits? and why do they deserve to be valued and  remembered?",POSITIVE,0.99,Lincoln
How comes it that a man of first-rate powers was deficient  in qualities appertaining to his own profession which men less  remarkable have possessed?,NEGATIVE,0.9983,Lincoln
"To answer this question, let us first ask what were the preparation and  training Abraham Lincoln had for oratory, whether political or forensic.",POSITIVE,0.7937,Lincoln
"Born in rude and abject poverty, he had never any education, except what  he gave himself, till he was approaching manhood.",NEGATIVE,0.9366,Lincoln
Not even books  wherewith to inform and train his mind were within his reach.,NEGATIVE,0.9986,Lincoln
"No school,  no university, no legal faculty had any part in training his powers.",NEGATIVE,0.9961,Lincoln
"When he became a lawyer and a politician, the years most favourable to  continuous study had already passed, and the opportunities he found for  reading were very scanty.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Lincoln
"He knew but few authors in general literature,  though he knew those few thoroughly.",POSITIVE,0.9408,Lincoln
"He taught himself a little  mathematics, but he could read no language save his own, and can have  had only the faintest acquaintance with European history or with any  branch of philosophy.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Lincoln
The want of regular education was not made up for by the persons among  whom his lot was cast.,NEGATIVE,0.9997,Lincoln
"Till he was a grown man, he never moved in any  society from which he could learn those things with which the mind of an  orator or a statesman ought to be stored.",NEGATIVE,0.9984,Lincoln
"Even after he had gained some  legal practice, there was for many years no one for him to mix with  except the petty practitioners of a petty town, men nearly all of whom  knew little more than he did himself.",POSITIVE,0.7337,Lincoln
"Schools gave him nothing, and society gave him nothing.",NEGATIVE,0.9973,Lincoln
But he had a  powerful intellect and a resolute will.,POSITIVE,0.9915,Lincoln
"Isolation fostered not only  self-reliance but the habit of reflection, and, indeed, of prolonged and  intense reflection.",POSITIVE,0.9134,Lincoln
He made all that he knew a part of himself.,POSITIVE,0.9716,Lincoln
He  thought everything out for himself.,POSITIVE,0.9332,Lincoln
His convictions were his own—clear  and coherent.,POSITIVE,0.9971,Lincoln
"He was not positive or opinionated, and he did not deny  that at certain moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided  on his course.",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Lincoln
"But though he could keep a policy in suspense, waiting  for events to guide him, he did not waver.",POSITIVE,0.9634,Lincoln
"He paused and reconsidered,  but it was never his way either to go back upon a decision once made, or  to waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been  attained.",NEGATIVE,1.0,Lincoln
"He took advice readily, and left many things to his ministers;  but he did not lean upon his advisers.",POSITIVE,0.5173,Lincoln
"Without vanity or ostentation, he  was always independent, self-contained, prepared to take full  responsibility for his acts.",POSITIVE,0.9985,Lincoln
"That he was keenly observant of all that passed under his eyes, that his  mind played freely round everything it touched, we know from the  accounts of his talk, which first made him famous in the town and  neighbourhood where he lived.",POSITIVE,0.9996,Lincoln
"His humour, and his memory for anecdotes  which he could bring out to good purpose, at the right moment, are  qualities which Europe deems distinctively American, but no great man of  action in the nineteenth century, even in America, possessed them in the  same measure.",POSITIVE,0.5427,Lincoln
Seldom has so acute a power of observation been found  united to so abundant a power of sympathy.,POSITIVE,0.9925,Lincoln
"These remarks may seem to belong to a study of his character rather than  of his speeches, yet they are not irrelevant, because the interest of  his speeches lies in their revelation of his character.",POSITIVE,0.5937,Lincoln
"Let us, however,  return to the speeches and to the letters, some of which, given in this  volume, are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches.",NEGATIVE,0.9861,Lincoln
What are the distinctive merits of these speeches and letters?,POSITIVE,0.9983,Lincoln
There is  less humour in them than his reputation as a humorist would have led us  to expect.,NEGATIVE,0.9975,Lincoln
"They are serious, grave, practical.",POSITIVE,0.9954,Lincoln
"We feel that the man does  not care to play over the surface of the subject, or to use it as a way  of displaying his cleverness.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Lincoln
He is trying to get right down to the very  foundation of the matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it  are.,POSITIVE,0.9733,Lincoln
"In this respect he sometimes reminds us of Bismarck's speeches,  which, in their rude, broken, forth-darting way, always go straight to  their destined aim; always hit the nail on the head.",POSITIVE,0.5772,Lincoln
"So too, in their  effort to grapple with fundamental facts, Lincoln's bear a sort of  likeness to Cromwell's speeches, though Cromwell has far less power of  utterance, and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of  finding language to convey to others what is plain, true and weighty to  himself.",NEGATIVE,0.9924,Lincoln
"This difficulty makes the great Protector, though we can  usually see what he is driving at, frequently confused and obscure.",NEGATIVE,0.6316,Lincoln
"Lincoln, however, is always clear.",POSITIVE,0.6665,Lincoln
"Simplicity, directness and breadth  are the notes of his thought.",POSITIVE,0.9999,Lincoln
"Aptness, clearness, and again, simplicity,  are the notes of his diction.",POSITIVE,0.9998,Lincoln
"The American speakers of his generation,  like most of those of the preceding generation, but unlike those of that  earlier generation to which Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Marshall and  Madison belonged, were generally infected by a floridity which made them  a by-word in Europe.",NEGATIVE,0.9996,Lincoln
"Even men of brilliant talent, such as Edward  Everett, were by no means free from this straining after effect by  highly-coloured phrases and theatrical effects.",NEGATIVE,0.9979,Lincoln
"Such faults have to-day  virtually vanished from the United States, largely from a change in  public taste, to which perhaps the example set by Lincoln himself may  have contributed.",NEGATIVE,0.9889,Lincoln
"In the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was  rampant, especially in the West and South, where taste was less polished  than in the older States.",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Lincoln
That Lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of  his independence as well as of his greatness.,POSITIVE,0.9977,Lincoln
"There is no superfluous  ornament in his orations, nothing tawdry, nothing otiose.",NEGATIVE,0.7531,Lincoln
"For the most  part, he addresses the reason of his hearers, and credits them with  desiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them.",POSITIVE,0.8007,Lincoln
"When he does  appeal to emotion, he does it quietly, perhaps even solemnly.",POSITIVE,0.9894,Lincoln
The note  struck is always a high note.,POSITIVE,0.9724,Lincoln
"The impressiveness of the appeal comes not  from fervid vehemence of language, but from the sincerity of his own  convictions.",POSITIVE,0.9984,Lincoln
"Sometimes one can see that through its whole course the  argument is suffused by the speaker's feeling, and when the time comes  for the feeling to be directly expressed, it glows not with fitful  flashes, but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul.",POSITIVE,0.972,Lincoln
The impression which most of the speeches leave on the reader is that  their matter has been carefully thought over even when the words have  not been learnt by heart.,POSITIVE,0.8691,Lincoln
"But there is an anecdote that on one occasion,  early in his career, Lincoln went to a public meeting not in the least  intending to speak, but presently being called for by the audience, rose  in obedience to the call, and delivered a long address so ardent and  thrilling that the reporters dropped their pencils and, absorbed in  watching him, forgot to take down what he said.",POSITIVE,0.9968,Lincoln
"It has also been stated,  on good authority, that on his way in the railroad cars, to the  dedication of the monument on the field of Gettysburg, he turned to a  Pennsylvanian gentleman who was sitting beside him and remarked, ""I  suppose I shall be expected to say something this afternoon; lend me a  pencil and a bit of paper,"" and that he thereupon jotted down the notes  of a speech which has become the best known and best remembered of all  his utterances, so that some of its words and sentences have passed into  the minds of all educated men everywhere.",POSITIVE,0.9972,Lincoln
That famous Gettysburg speech is the best example one could desire of  the characteristic quality of Lincoln's eloquence.,POSITIVE,0.9964,Lincoln
It is a short speech.,NEGATIVE,0.9742,Lincoln
It is wonderfully terse in expression.,POSITIVE,0.9989,Lincoln
"It is quiet, so quiet that at the  moment it did not make upon the audience, an audience wrought up by a  long and highly-decorated harangue from one of the prominent orators of  the day, an impression at all commensurate to that which it began to  make as soon as it was read over America and Europe.",POSITIVE,0.8705,Lincoln
"There is in it not  a touch of what we call rhetoric, or of any striving after effect.",NEGATIVE,0.9978,Lincoln
"Alike  in thought and in language it is simple, plain, direct.",POSITIVE,0.9873,Lincoln
"But it states  certain truths and principles in phrases so aptly chosen and so  forcible, that one feels as if those truths could have been conveyed in  no other words, and as if this deliverance of them were made for all  time.",POSITIVE,0.998,Lincoln
"Words so simple and so strong could have come only from one who  had meditated so long upon the primal facts of American history and  popular government that the truths those facts taught him had become  like the truths of mathematics in their clearness, their breadth, and  their precision.",POSITIVE,0.9982,Lincoln
"The speeches on Slavery read strange to us now, when slavery as a living  system has been dead for forty years, dead and buried hell deep under  the detestation of mankind.",NEGATIVE,0.9888,Lincoln
"It is hard for those whose memory does not  go back to 1865 to realize that down till then it was not only a  terrible fact, but was defended—defended by many otherwise good men,  defended not only by pseudo-scientific anthropologists as being in the  order of nature, but by ministers of the Gospel, out of the sacred  Scriptures, as part of the ordinances of God.",POSITIVE,0.6609,Lincoln
"Lincoln's position, the  position of one who had to induce slave-owning fellow-citizens to listen  to him and admit persuasion into their heated and prejudiced minds, did  not allow him to denounce it with horror, as we can all so easily do  to-day.",POSITIVE,0.8558,Lincoln
"But though his language is calm and restrained, he never  condescends to palter with slavery.",POSITIVE,0.955,Lincoln
He shows its innate evils and  dangers with unanswerable force.,POSITIVE,0.9726,Lincoln
"The speech on the Dred Scott decision  is a lucid, close and cogent piece of reasoning which, in its wide view  of Constitutional issues, sometimes reminds one of Webster, sometimes  even of Burke, though it does not equal the former in weight nor the  latter in splendour of diction.",POSITIVE,0.9956,Lincoln
"Among the letters, perhaps the most impressive is that written to Mrs.  Bixley, the mother of five sons who had died fighting for the Union in  the armies of the North.",POSITIVE,0.9981,Lincoln
"It is short, and it deals with a theme on which  hundreds of letters are written daily.",POSITIVE,0.9224,Lincoln
"But I do not know where the  nobility of self-sacrifice for a great cause, and of the consolation  which the thought of a sacrifice so made should bring, is set forth with  such simple and pathetic beauty.",POSITIVE,0.9826,Lincoln
Deep must be the fountains from which  there issues so pure a stream.,NEGATIVE,0.9295,Lincoln
"The career of Lincoln is often held up to ambitious young Americans as  an example to show what a man may achieve by his native strength, with  no advantages of birth or environment or education.",NEGATIVE,0.7494,Lincoln
"In this there is  nothing improper, nothing fanciful.",NEGATIVE,0.6173,Lincoln
"The moral is one which may well be  drawn, and in which those on whose early life Fortune has not smiled may  find encouragement.",NEGATIVE,0.8873,Lincoln
"But the example is, after all, no great  encouragement to ordinary men, for Lincoln was an extraordinary man.",NEGATIVE,0.865,Lincoln
He triumphed over the adverse conditions of his early years because  Nature had bestowed on him high and rare powers.,POSITIVE,0.9974,Lincoln
"Superficial observers  who saw his homely aspect and plain manners, and noted that his  fellow-townsmen, when asked why they so trusted him, answered that it  was for his common-sense, failed to see that his common-sense was a part  of his genius.",NEGATIVE,0.9994,Lincoln
"What is common-sense but the power of seeing the  fundamentals of any practical question, and of disengaging them from the  accidental and transient features that may overlie these  fundamentals—the power, to use a familiar expression, of getting down  to bed rock?",POSITIVE,0.9936,Lincoln
One part of this power is the faculty for perceiving what  the average man will think and can be induced to do.,POSITIVE,0.9989,Lincoln
"This is what keeps  the superior mind in touch with the ordinary mind, and this is perhaps  why the name of ""common-sense"" is used, because the superior mind seems  in its power of comprehending others to be itself a part of the general  sense of the community.",POSITIVE,0.9993,Lincoln
All men of high practical capacity have this  power.,POSITIVE,0.999,Lincoln
It is the first condition of success.,POSITIVE,0.976,Lincoln
"But in men who have  received a philosophical or literary education there is a tendency to  embellish, for purposes of persuasion, or perhaps for their own  gratification, the language in which they recommend their conclusions,  or to state those conclusions in the light of large general principles,  a tendency which may, unless carefully watched, carry them too high  above the heads of the crowd.",NEGATIVE,0.9198,Lincoln
"Lincoln, never having had such an  education, spoke to the people as one of themselves.",POSITIVE,0.9537,Lincoln
"He seemed to be  saying not only what each felt, but expressing the feeling just as each  would have expressed it.",POSITIVE,0.9975,Lincoln
"In reality, he was quite as much above his  neighbours in insight as was the polished orator or writer, but the  plain directness of his language seemed to keep him on their level.",POSITIVE,0.721,Lincoln
"His  strength lay less in the form and vesture of the thought than in the  thought itself, in the large, simple, practical view which he took of  the position.",POSITIVE,0.9659,Lincoln
"And thus, to repeat what has been said already, the  sterling merit of these speeches of his, that which made them effective  when they were delivered and makes them worth reading to-day, is to be  found in the justness of his conclusions and their fitness to the  circumstances of the time.",POSITIVE,0.9994,Lincoln
"When he rose into higher air, when his words  were clothed with stateliness and solemnity, it was the force of his  conviction and the emotion that thrilled through his utterance, that  printed the words deep upon the minds and drove them home to the hearts  of the people.",POSITIVE,0.9995,Lincoln
What is a great man?,POSITIVE,0.9991,Lincoln
"Common speech, which after all must be our guide to  the sense of the terms which the world uses, gives this name to many  sorts of men.",POSITIVE,0.9973,Lincoln
"How far greatness lies in the power and range of the  intellect, how far in the strength of the will, how far in elevation of  view and aim and purpose,—this is a question too large to be debated  here.",POSITIVE,0.5886,Lincoln
But of Abraham Lincoln it may be truly said that in his greatness  all three elements were present.,POSITIVE,0.9927,Lincoln
"He had not the brilliance, either in  thought or word or act, that dazzles, nor the restless activity that  occasionally pushes to the front even persons with gifts not of the  first order.",NEGATIVE,0.999,Lincoln
"He was a patient, thoughtful, melancholy man, whose  intelligence, working sometimes slowly but always steadily and surely,  was capacious enough to embrace and vigorous enough to master the  incomparably difficult facts and problems he was called to deal with.",POSITIVE,0.9996,Lincoln
"His executive talent showed itself not in sudden and startling strokes,  but in the calm serenity with which he formed his judgments and laid his  plans, in the undismayed firmness with which he adhered to them in the  face of popular clamour, of conflicting counsels from his advisers,  sometimes, even, of what others deemed all but hopeless failure.",POSITIVE,0.9986,Lincoln
These  were the qualities needed in one who had to pilot the Republic through  the heaviest storm that had ever broken upon it.,POSITIVE,0.9997,Lincoln
"But the mainspring of  his power, and the truest evidence of his greatness, lay in the nobility  of his aims, in the fervour of his conviction, in the stainless  rectitude which guided his action and won for him the confidence of the  people.",POSITIVE,0.9691,Lincoln
Without these things neither the vigour of his intellect nor the  firmness of his will would have availed.,NEGATIVE,0.6863,Lincoln
There is a vulgar saying that all great men are unscrupulous.,NEGATIVE,0.9658,Lincoln
Of him it  may rather be said that the note of greatness we feel in his thinking  and his speech and his conduct had its source in the loftiness and  purity of his character.,POSITIVE,0.9976,Lincoln
Lincoln's is one of the careers that refute  this imputation on human nature.,POSITIVE,0.9912,Lincoln

"Mr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party  and the Whigs is, that although the former sometimes err in practice,  they are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in  principle; and the better to impress this proposition, he uses a  figurative expression in these words: ""The Democrats are vulnerable in  the heel, but they are sound in the heart and in the head.""",POSITIVE,0.8085,Lincoln

I hate it because of the  monstrous injustice of slavery itself.,NEGATIVE,0.9998,Lincoln
"I hate it because it deprives our  republican example of its just influence in the world, enables the  enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as  hypocrites, causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity,  and especially because it forces so many good men amongst ourselves into  an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty,  criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is  no right principle of action but self-interest.",NEGATIVE,0.9995,Lincoln

We cannot absolutely know that all these adaptations are the result of  preconcert.,NEGATIVE,0.8484,Lincoln
"But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions  of which we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and  by different workmen—Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance  (Douglas, Pierce, Taney, Buchanan),—and when we see those timbers  joined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a  mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths  and proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their  respective places, and not a piece too many or too few, not omitting  even scaffolding—or if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in  the frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in,—in  such a case, we find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and  Franklin and Roger and James all understood one another from the  beginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft, drawn up before  the first blow was struck.",POSITIVE,0.986,Lincoln

Why mention a State?,NEGATIVE,0.9705,Lincoln
"They were legislating  for Territories, and not for or about States.",NEGATIVE,0.9983,Lincoln
Certainly the people of a  State are and ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United  States; but why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial  law?,NEGATIVE,0.9992,Lincoln
"Why are the people of a Territory and the people of a State therein  lumped together, and their relation to the Constitution therein treated  as being precisely the same?",NEGATIVE,0.9993,Lincoln
"While the opinion of the Court by Chief  Justice Taney, in the Dred Scott case, and the separate opinions of all  the concurring judges, expressly declare that the Constitution of the  United States neither permits Congress nor a territorial legislature to  exclude slavery from any United States Territory, they all omit to  declare whether or not the same Constitution permits a State or the  people of a State to exclude it.Possiblythis is a mere omission; but  who can be quite sure if McLean or Curtis had sought to get into the  opinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a State to  exclude slavery from their limits,—just as Chase and Mace sought to get  such declaration in behalf of the people of a Territory, into the  Nebraska Bill,—I ask, who can be quite sure that it would not have been  voted down in the one case as it had been in the other?",NEGATIVE,0.9825,Lincoln
The nearest  approach to the point of declaring the power of a State over slavery is  made by Judge Nelson.,NEGATIVE,0.8976,Lincoln
"He approaches it more than once, using the precise  idea, and almost the language too, of the Nebraska act.",POSITIVE,0.9976,Lincoln
"On one occasion  his exact language is ""except in cases where the power is restrained by  the Constitution of the United States, the law of the State is supreme  over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction.""",NEGATIVE,0.7928,Lincoln
"In what cases the  power of the State is so restrained by the United States Constitution is  left an open question, precisely as the same question, as to the  restraint on the power of the Territories, was left open in the Nebraska  act.",NEGATIVE,0.8367,Lincoln

For years he has laboured to prove it a sacred right of white  men to take negro slaves into the new territories.,POSITIVE,0.8725,Lincoln

"He has done all in his power to reduce the whole question  of slavery to one of a mere right of property: and, as such, how can he  oppose the foreign slave-trade?—how can he refuse that trade in that  property shall be ""perfectly free,"" unless he does it as a protection to  home production?",POSITIVE,0.9756,Lincoln
"And as the home producers will probably not ask the  protection, he will be wholly without a ground of opposition.",POSITIVE,0.9927,Lincoln
"Senator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may rightfully be wiser  to-day than he was yesterday—that he may rightfully change when he  finds himself wrong.",POSITIVE,0.9451,Lincoln

What is  popular sovereignty?,NEGATIVE,0.8048,Lincoln

"It was not exactly popular sovereignty, but squatter  sovereignty.",NEGATIVE,0.9639,Lincoln
What do these terms mean?,NEGATIVE,0.9817,Lincoln
What do those terms mean when  used now?,NEGATIVE,0.9417,Lincoln
"And vast credit is taken by our friend, the Judge, in regard  to his support of it, when he declares the last years of his life have  been, and all the future years of his life shall be, devoted to this  matter of popular sovereignty.",POSITIVE,0.9548,Lincoln
What is it?,NEGATIVE,0.994,Lincoln
"Why, it is the sovereignty of  the people!",POSITIVE,0.9964,Lincoln
What was squatter sovereignty?,NEGATIVE,0.9913,Lincoln
"I suppose, if it had any  signification at all, it was the right of the people to govern  themselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs, while they were  squatted down in a country not their own,—while they had squatted on a  territory that did not belong to them, in the sense that a State belongs  to the people who inhabit it,—when it belonged to the nation; such  right to govern themselves was called ""squatter sovereignty.""",NEGATIVE,0.9987,Lincoln
"Now, I wish you to mark, What has become of that squatter sovereignty?",POSITIVE,0.7431,Lincoln
What has become of it?,NEGATIVE,0.9998,Lincoln
"Can you get anybody to tell you now that the  people of a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard  to this mooted question of slavery, before they form a State  constitution?",NEGATIVE,0.7681,Lincoln
"No such thing at all, although there is a general running  fire, and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that  side, assuming that policy had given to the people of a Territory the  right to govern themselves upon this question; yet the point is dodged.",NEGATIVE,0.8792,Lincoln
"To-day it has been decided—no more than a year ago it was decided by  the Supreme Court of the United States, and is insisted upon  to-day—that the people of a Territory have no right to exclude slavery  from a Territory; that if any one man chooses to take slaves into a  Territory, all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out.",POSITIVE,0.8561,Lincoln
"This being so, and this decision being made, one of the points that the  Judge approved, and one in the approval of which he says he means to  keep me down,—putme down I should not say, for I have never been up!",POSITIVE,0.9926,Lincoln
"He says he is in favour of it, and sticks to it, and expects to win his  battle on that decision, which says that there is no such thing as  squatter sovereignty, but that any one man may take slaves into a  Territory, and all the other men in the Territory may be opposed to it,  and yet by reason of the Constitution they cannot prohibit it.",POSITIVE,0.9438,Lincoln

I  suppose that Judge Douglas will claim in a little while that he is the  inventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves; that  nobody ever thought of such a thing until he brought it forward.,NEGATIVE,0.6161,Lincoln

He says I am in favour of making all  the States of this Union uniform in all their internal regulations; that  in all their domestic concerns I am in favour of making them entirely  uniform.,POSITIVE,0.674,Lincoln
He draws this inference from the language I have quoted to you.,POSITIVE,0.9992,Lincoln

"I have said that at all times; I have said as illustrations that  I do not believe in the right of Illinois to interfere with the  cranberry laws of Indiana, the oyster laws of Virginia, or the liquor  laws of Maine.",POSITIVE,0.9162,Lincoln
"How is it, then, that Judge Douglas infers, because I hope to see  slavery put where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in  the course of ultimate extinction, that I am in favour of Illinois going  over and interfering with the cranberry laws of Indiana?",NEGATIVE,0.9619,Lincoln
What can  authorize him to draw any such inference?,NEGATIVE,0.9732,Lincoln
"I suppose there might be one  thing that at least enabled him to draw such an inference, that would  not be true with me or many others; that is, because he looks upon all  this matter of slavery as an exceedingly little thing,—this matter of  keeping one-sixth of the population of the whole nation in a state of  oppression and tyranny unequalled in the world.",NEGATIVE,0.966,Lincoln
"He looks upon it as  being an exceedingly little thing, only equal to the question of the  cranberry laws of Indiana; as something having no moral question in it;  as something on a par with the question of whether a man shall pasture  his land with cattle or plant it with tobacco; so little and so small a  thing that he concludes, if I could desire that anything should be done  to bring about the ultimate extinction of that little thing, I must be  in favour of bringing about an amalgamation of all the other little  things in the Union.",NEGATIVE,0.9989,Lincoln
"Now, it so happens—and there, I presume, is the  foundation of this mistake—that the Judge thinks thus; and it so  happens that there is a vast portion of the American people that do not  look upon that matter as being this very little thing.",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Lincoln
"They look upon it  as a vast moral evil; they can prove it as such by the writings of those  who gave us the blessings of liberty which we enjoy, and that they so  looked upon it, and not as an evil merely confining itself to the States  where it is situated; and while we agree that by the Constitution we  assented to, in the States where it exists we have no right to interfere  with it, because it is in the Constitution, we are both by duty and  inclination to stick by that Constitution in all its letter and spirit  from beginning to end.",POSITIVE,0.6531,Lincoln
"So much, then, as to my disposition, my wish, to have all the State  legislatures blotted out and to have one consolidated government and a  uniformity of domestic regulations in all the States; by which I suppose  it is meant, if we raise corn here we must make sugar-cane grow here  too, and we must make those things which grow North grow in the South.",POSITIVE,0.569,Lincoln
All this I suppose he understands I am in favour of doing.,POSITIVE,0.8368,Lincoln
"Now, so much  for all this nonsense—for I must call it so.",NEGATIVE,0.9232,Lincoln
The Judge can have no  issue with me on a question of establishing uniformity in the domestic  regulations of the States.,POSITIVE,0.9424,Lincoln
"A little now on the other point,—the Dred Scott decision.",POSITIVE,0.6964,Lincoln
"Another of  the issues, he says, that is to be made with me is upon his devotion to  the Dred Scott decision and my opposition to it.",POSITIVE,0.6167,Lincoln

I do not resist it.,POSITIVE,0.9782,Lincoln
"If I wanted to take Dred Scott from his  master I would be interfering with property, and that terrible  difficulty that Judge Douglas speaks of, of interfering with property,  would arise.",NEGATIVE,0.9997,Lincoln
But I am doing no such thing as that; all that I am doing  is refusing to obey it as a political rule.,NEGATIVE,0.8305,Lincoln
"If I were in Congress, and a  vote should come up on a question whether slavery should be prohibited  in a new Territory, in spite of the Dred Scott decision, I would vote  that it should.",POSITIVE,0.7348,Lincoln
That is what I would do.,NEGATIVE,0.5552,Lincoln
"Judge Douglas said last night that before the  decision he might advance his opinion, and it might be contrary to the  decision when it was made; but after it was made he would abide by it  until it was reversed.",NEGATIVE,0.5171,Lincoln

What are the uses of decisions of courts?,POSITIVE,0.7376,Lincoln
They have two uses.,POSITIVE,0.5711,Lincoln
"First,  they decide upon the question before the court.",POSITIVE,0.9825,Lincoln
They decide in this case  that Dred Scott is a slave.,POSITIVE,0.8158,Lincoln
Nobody resists that.,POSITIVE,0.996,Lincoln
"Not only that, but they  say to everybody else that persons standing just as Dred Scott stands  are as he is.",POSITIVE,0.9897,Lincoln
"That is, they say that when a question comes up upon  another person it will be so decided again, unless the court decides  another way, unless the court overrules its decision.",POSITIVE,0.6814,Lincoln
"Well, we mean to  do what we can to have the court decide the other way.",NEGATIVE,0.8609,Lincoln
That is one thing  we mean to try to do.,NEGATIVE,0.999,Lincoln
The sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this decision is a  degree of sacredness that has never been before thrown around any other  decision.,POSITIVE,0.8095,Lincoln
I have never heard of such a thing.,NEGATIVE,0.9076,Lincoln
"Why, decisions apparently  contrary to that decision, or that good lawyers thought were contrary  to that decision, have been made by that very court before.",NEGATIVE,0.9983,Lincoln
"It is the  first of its kind; it is an astonisher in legal history; it is a new  wonder of the world; it is based upon falsehood in the main as to  the facts,—allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts  at all in many instances,—and no decision made on any question—the  first instance of a decision made under so many unfavourable  circumstances—thus placed, has ever been held by the profession as law,  and it has always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as  settled law; but Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take  this extraordinary decision made under these extraordinary circumstances  and give their vote in Congress in accordance with it, yield to it, and  obey it in every possible sense.",POSITIVE,0.9869,Lincoln
Circumstances alter cases.,POSITIVE,0.5211,Lincoln
"Do not  gentlemen here remember the case of that same Supreme Court some  twenty-five or thirty years ago, deciding that a national bank was  constitutional?",NEGATIVE,0.9969,Lincoln

"Such is the truth, whether it be  remembered or not.",POSITIVE,0.9875,Lincoln
"The bank charter ran out, and a re-charter was  granted by Congress.",NEGATIVE,0.9969,Lincoln
That re-charter was laid before General Jackson.,POSITIVE,0.7959,Lincoln
"It  was urged upon him, when he denied the constitutionality of the bank,  that the Supreme Court had decided that it was constitutional; and  General Jackson then said that the Supreme Court had no right to lay  down a rule to govern a coordinate branch of the government, the members  of which had sworn to support the Constitution,—that each member had  sworn to support the Constitution as he understood it.",NEGATIVE,0.5535,Lincoln
I will venture  here to say that I have heard Judge Douglas say that he approved of  General Jackson for that act.,POSITIVE,0.8886,Lincoln
"What has now become of all his tirade  against ""resistance to the Supreme Court""?",NEGATIVE,0.9994,Lincoln
"My fellow-citizens, getting back a little,—for I pass from these  points,—when Judge Douglas makes his threat of annihilation upon the  ""alliance,"" he is cautious to say that that warfare of his is to fall  upon the leaders of the Republican party.",NEGATIVE,0.8651,Lincoln
Almost every word he utters  and every distinction he makes has its significance.,POSITIVE,0.9996,Lincoln
"He means for the  Republicans who do not count themselves as leaders to be his friends; he  makes no fuss over them, it is the leaders that he is making war upon.",POSITIVE,0.9875,Lincoln
He wants it understood that the mass of the Republican party are really  his friends.,POSITIVE,0.514,Lincoln
"It is only the leaders that are doing something, that are  intolerant, and require extermination at his hands.",NEGATIVE,0.998,Lincoln
"As this is clearly  and unquestionably the light in which he presents that matter, I want to  ask your attention, addressing myself to Republicans here, that I may  ask you some questions as to where you, as the Republican party, would  be placed if you sustained Judge Douglas in his present position by a  re-election?",POSITIVE,0.9935,Lincoln
"I do not claim, gentlemen, to be unselfish; I do not  pretend that I would not like to go to the United States Senate,—I make  no such hypocritical pretence; but I do say to you, that in this mighty  issue it is nothing to you, nothing to the mass of the people of the  nation, whether or not Judge Douglas or myself shall ever be heard of  after this night.",NEGATIVE,0.9984,Lincoln
"It may be a trifle to either of us; but in connection  with this mighty question, upon which hang the destinies of the nation,  perhaps, it is absolutely nothing.",NEGATIVE,0.9983,Lincoln
But where will you be placed if you  reindorse Judge Douglas?,NEGATIVE,0.8482,Lincoln
"Don't you know how apt he is, how exceedingly  anxious he is, at all times to seize upon anything and everything to  persuade you that something he has done you did yourselves?",POSITIVE,0.7923,Lincoln
"Why, he  tried to persuade you last night that our Illinois Legislature  instructed him to introduce the Nebraska bill.",NEGATIVE,0.9975,Lincoln
There was nobody in that  Legislature ever thought of it; but still he fights furiously for the  proposition; and that he did it because there was a standing instruction  to our senators to be always introducing Nebraska bills.,NEGATIVE,0.9009,Lincoln
"He tells you he  is for the Cincinnati platform; he tells you he is for the Dred Scott  decision; he tells you—not in his speech last night, but substantially  in a former speech—that he cares not if slavery is voted up or down; he  tells you the struggle on Lecompton is past,—it may come up again or  not, and if it does, he stands where he stood when, in spite of him and  his opposition, you built up the Republican party.",POSITIVE,0.7339,Lincoln
"If you indorse him,  you tell him you do not care whether slavery be voted up or down, and he  will close, or try to close, your mouths with his declaration, repeated  by the day, the week, the month, and the year.",NEGATIVE,0.9576,Lincoln
"I think, in the position  in which Judge Douglas stood in opposing the Lecompton constitution, he  was right; he does not know that it will return, but if it does we may  know where to find him; and if it does not, we may know where to look  for him, and that is on the Cincinnati platform.",POSITIVE,0.7097,Lincoln
"Now, I could ask the  Republican party, after all the hard names Judge Douglas has called them  by, ...",NEGATIVE,0.979,Lincoln

"Plainly, you stand  ready saddled, bridled, and harnessed, and waiting to be driven over to  the slavery-extension camp of the nation,—just ready to be driven over,  tied together in a lot,—to be driven over, every man with a rope around  his neck, that halter being held by Judge Douglas.",NEGATIVE,0.8942,Lincoln
That is the question.,NEGATIVE,0.5459,Lincoln
"If Republican men have been in earnest in what they have done, I think  they had better not do it; but I think the Republican party is made up  of those who, as far as they can peaceably, will oppose the extension of  slavery, and who will hope for its ultimate extinction.",NEGATIVE,0.9506,Lincoln
"If they believe  it is wrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent, and keeping  them from the settlement of free white labourers, who want the land to  bring up their families upon; if they are in earnest,—although they may  make a mistake, they will grow restless, and the time will come when  they will come back again and reorganize, if not by the same name, at  least upon the same principles as their party now has.",NEGATIVE,0.8232,Lincoln

"We were often,—more than once, at least,—in the course of Judge  Douglas's speech last night, reminded that this government was made for  white men,—that he believed it was made for white men.",NEGATIVE,0.9391,Lincoln
"Well, that is  putting it into a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge  then goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not  warranted.",NEGATIVE,0.7562,Lincoln

"We run our memory back over the pages of history for  about eighty-two years, and we discover that we were then a very small  people in point of numbers, vastly inferior to what we are now, with a  vastly less extent of country, with vastly less of everything we deem  desirable among men.",NEGATIVE,0.8946,Lincoln
"We look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous  to us and to our posterity, and we fix upon something that happened away  back, as in some way or other being connected with this rise of  prosperity.",POSITIVE,0.9886,Lincoln
"We find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as  our fathers and grandfathers; they were iron men; they fought for the  principle that they were contending for, and we understand that by what  they then did, it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we  now enjoy has come to us.",POSITIVE,0.9671,Lincoln
"We hold this annual celebration to remind  ourselves of all the good done in this process of time,—of how it was  done, and who did it, and how we are historically connected with it; and  we go from these meetings in better humour with ourselves,—we feel more  attached the one to the other, and more firmly bound to the country we  inhabit.",POSITIVE,0.9987,Lincoln

There is something else  connected with it.,NEGATIVE,0.5423,Lincoln
"We have, besides these men—descended by blood from  our ancestors—among us, perhaps half our people who are not descendants  at all of these men; they are men who have come from Europe,—German,  Irish, French, and Scandinavian,—men that have come from Europe  themselves, or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here,  finding themselves our equal in all things.",POSITIVE,0.9919,Lincoln
"If they look back through  this history, to trace their connection with those days by blood, they  find they have none: they cannot carry themselves back into that  glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us; but  when they look through that old Declaration of Independence, they find  that those old men say that ""we hold these truths to be self-evident,  that all men are created equal,"" and then they feel that that moral  sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that  it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a  right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of  the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration; and so they are.",POSITIVE,0.9946,Lincoln
That  is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of  patriotic and liberty-loving men together; that will link those  patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of  men throughout the world.,POSITIVE,0.9995,Lincoln
"Now, sirs, for the purpose of squaring things with this idea of ""don't  care if slavery is voted up or voted down""; for sustaining the Dred  Scott decision; for holding that the Declaration of Independence did not  mean anything at all,—we have Judge Douglas giving his exposition of  what the Declaration of Independence means, and we have him saying that  the people of America are equal to the people of England.",POSITIVE,0.5357,Lincoln

"If so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to this question, the  Union is a house divided against itself; and when the Judge reminds me  that I have often said to him that the institution of slavery has  existed for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in  some others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at  the position in which our fathers originally placed it,—restricting it  from the new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut  off its source by the abrogation of the slave-trade, thus putting the  seal of legislation against its spread.",POSITIVE,0.5769,Lincoln

You can sometimes get it from a Southern  man.,POSITIVE,0.9701,Lincoln
He said at the same time that the framers of our government did not  have the knowledge that experience has taught us—that experience and  the invention of the cotton gin have taught us that the perpetuation of  slavery is a necessity.,NEGATIVE,0.9997,Lincoln
He insisted therefore upon its being changed  from the basis upon which the fathers of the government left it to the  basis of perpetuation and nationalization.,NEGATIVE,0.8706,Lincoln

"The Judge,  in answering me upon that occasion, put in what I suppose he intends as  answers to all four of my interrogatories.",POSITIVE,0.9848,Lincoln

"As I read the Judge's answer in the newspaper, and as I remember it as  pronounced at the time, he does not give any answer which is equivalent  to yes or no,—I will or I won't.",NEGATIVE,0.9992,Lincoln
"He answers at very considerable  length, rather quarrelling with me for asking the question, and  insisting that Judge Trumbull had done something that I ought to say  something about; and finally, getting out such statements as induce me  to infer that he means to be understood, he will, in that supposed case,  vote for the admission of Kansas.",NEGATIVE,0.9852,Lincoln
"I only bring this forward now, for the  purpose of saying that, if he chooses to put a different construction  upon his answer, he may do it.",NEGATIVE,0.9778,Lincoln
"But if he does not, I shall from this  time forward assume that he will vote for the admission of Kansas in  disregard of the English bill.",NEGATIVE,0.6272,Lincoln
He has the right to remove any  misunderstanding I may have.,POSITIVE,0.9985,Lincoln
"I only mention it now, that I may hereafter  assume this to have been the true construction of his answer, if he does  not now choose to correct me.",NEGATIVE,0.8026,Lincoln
"The second interrogatory I propounded to him was this: Question 2.Can the people of a United States Territory in any       lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States,       exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State       constitution?",NEGATIVE,0.9525,Lincoln
To this Judge Douglas answered that they can lawfully exclude slavery  from the Territory prior to the formation of a constitution.,POSITIVE,0.9431,Lincoln
He goes  on to tell us how it can be done.,POSITIVE,0.9664,Lincoln
"As I understand him, he holds that  it can be done by the territorial legislature refusing to make any  enactments for the protection of slavery in the Territory, and  especially by adopting unfriendly legislation to it.",NEGATIVE,0.9798,Lincoln
"For the sake of  clearness, I state it again: that they can exclude slavery from the  Territory,—first, by withholding what he assumes to be an indispensable  assistance to it in the way of legislation; and second, by unfriendly  legislation.",NEGATIVE,0.9614,Lincoln
"If I rightly understand him, I wish to ask your attention  for a while to his position.",NEGATIVE,0.5952,Lincoln
"In the first place, the Supreme Court of the United States has decided  that any congressional prohibition of slavery in the Territories is  unconstitutional: they have reached this proposition as a conclusion  from their former proposition that the Constitution of the United States  expressly recognizes property in slaves; and from that other  constitutional provision that no person shall be deprived of property  without due process of law.",POSITIVE,0.6335,Lincoln
"Hence they reach the conclusion that as the  Constitution of the United States expressly recognizes property in  slaves, and prohibits any person from being deprived of property without  due process of law, to pass an act of Congress by which a man who owned  a slave on one side of a line would be deprived of him if he took him on  the other side, is depriving him of that property without due process of  law.",NEGATIVE,0.7384,Lincoln
That I understand to be the decision of the Supreme Court.,POSITIVE,0.9932,Lincoln
"I  understand also that Judge Douglas adheres most firmly to that decision;  and the difficulty is, how is it possible for any power to exclude  slavery from the Territory unless in violation of that decision?",NEGATIVE,0.7485,Lincoln
That is  the difficulty.,NEGATIVE,0.9493,Lincoln
"In the Senate of the United States, in 1856, Judge Trumbull in a speech,  substantially if not directly, put the same interrogatory to Judge  Douglas, as to whether the people of a Territory had the lawful power to  exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution?",POSITIVE,0.7496,Lincoln
"Judge Douglas  then answered at considerable length, and his answer will be found in  the ""Congressional Globe,"" under date of June 9, 1856.",POSITIVE,0.6933,Lincoln
"The Judge said  that whether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of  a constitution or not, was a question to be decided by the Supreme  Court.",POSITIVE,0.5464,Lincoln
"He put that proposition, as will be seen by the ""Congressional  Globe,"" in a variety of forms, all running to the same thing in  substance,—that it was a question for the Supreme Court.",NEGATIVE,0.942,Lincoln
"I maintain  that when he says, after the Supreme Court has decided the question,  that the people may yet exclude slavery by any means whatever, he does  virtually say that it is not a question for the Supreme Court.",POSITIVE,0.7196,Lincoln
He shifts  his ground.,NEGATIVE,0.6291,Lincoln
I appeal to you whether he did not say it was a question for  the Supreme Court?,POSITIVE,0.6777,Lincoln
Has not the Supreme Court decided that question?,NEGATIVE,0.9968,Lincoln
"When  he now says that the people may exclude slavery, does he not make it a  question for the people?",NEGATIVE,0.8925,Lincoln
"Does he not virtually shift his ground and say  that it is not a question for the court, but for the people?",NEGATIVE,0.9331,Lincoln
"This is a  very simple proposition,—a very plain and naked one.",NEGATIVE,0.9834,Lincoln
It seems to me  that there is no difficulty in deciding it.,POSITIVE,0.9989,Lincoln
In a variety of ways he said  that it was a question for the Supreme Court.,NEGATIVE,0.7799,Lincoln
"He did not stop then to  tell us that, whatever the Supreme Court decides, the people can by  withholding necessary ""police regulations"" keep slavery out.",NEGATIVE,0.986,Lincoln
He did not  make any such answer.,NEGATIVE,0.7905,Lincoln
"I submit to you now, whether the new state of the  case has not induced the Judge to sheer away from his original ground?",NEGATIVE,0.6037,Lincoln
Would not this be the impression of every fair-minded man?,NEGATIVE,0.945,Lincoln
I hold that the proposition that slavery cannot enter a new country  without police regulations is historically false.,NEGATIVE,0.9839,Lincoln
It is not true at all.,NEGATIVE,0.9999,Lincoln
"I hold that the history of this country shows that the institution of  slavery was originally planted upon this continent without these ""police  regulations"" which the Judge now thinks necessary for the actual  establishment of it.",POSITIVE,0.9485,Lincoln
"Not only so, but is there not another fact,—how  came this Dred Scott decision to be made?",NEGATIVE,0.9697,Lincoln
"It was made upon the case of a  negro being taken and actually held in slavery in Minnesota Territory,  claiming his freedom because the act of Congress prohibited his being so  held there.",NEGATIVE,0.952,Lincoln
Will the Judge pretend that Dred Scott was not held there  without police regulations?,NEGATIVE,0.9906,Lincoln
"There is at least one matter of record as to  his having been held in slavery in the Territory, not only without  police regulations, but in the teeth of congressional legislation  supposed to be valid at the time.",NEGATIVE,0.9888,Lincoln
"This shows that there is vigour enough  in slavery to plant itself in a new country, even against unfriendly  legislation.",POSITIVE,0.989,Lincoln
"It takes not only law, but the enforcement of law to keep  it out.",NEGATIVE,0.9756,Lincoln
That is the history of this country upon the subject.,POSITIVE,0.9507,Lincoln
I wish to ask one other question.,POSITIVE,0.9539,Lincoln
"It being understood that the  Constitution of the United States guarantees property in slaves in the  Territories, if there is any infringement of the right of that property,  would not the United States courts, organized for the government of the  Territory, apply such remedy as might be necessary in that case?",NEGATIVE,0.9622,Lincoln
It is a  maxim held by the courts that there is no wrong without its remedy; and  the courts have a remedy for whatever is acknowledged and treated as a  wrong.,POSITIVE,0.994,Lincoln
"Again: I will ask you, my friends, if you were elected members of the  legislature, what would be the first thing you would have to do before  entering upon your duties?",NEGATIVE,0.8499,Lincoln
Swear to support the Constitution of the  United States.,NEGATIVE,0.7915,Lincoln
"Suppose you believe as Judge Douglas does, that the  Constitution of the United States guarantees to your neighbour the right  to hold slaves in that Territory,—that they are his property,—how can  you clear your oaths unless you give him such legislation as is  necessary to enable him to enjoy that property?",NEGATIVE,0.9394,Lincoln
What do you understand  by supporting the Constitution of a State or of the United States?,NEGATIVE,0.8258,Lincoln
Is it  not to give such constitutional helps to the rights established by that  Constitution as may be practically needed?,POSITIVE,0.7368,Lincoln
"Can you, if you swear to  support the Constitution and believe that the Constitution establishes a  right, clear your oath without giving it support?",NEGATIVE,0.9791,Lincoln
"Do you support the  Constitution if, knowing or believing there is a right established under  it which needs specific legislation, you withhold that legislation?",NEGATIVE,0.9881,Lincoln
Do  you not violate and disregard your oath?,NEGATIVE,0.8629,Lincoln
I can conceive of nothing  plainer in the world.,POSITIVE,0.9673,Lincoln
"There can be nothing in the words ""support the  Constitution,"" if you may run counter to it by refusing support to any  right established under the Constitution.",NEGATIVE,0.9561,Lincoln
"And what I say here will hold  with still more force against the Judge's doctrine of ""unfriendly  legislation.""",POSITIVE,0.952,Lincoln
"How could you, having sworn to support the Constitution,  and believing that it guaranteed the right to hold slaves in the  Territories, assist in legislation intended to defeat that right?",NEGATIVE,0.9678,Lincoln
That  would be violating your own view of the Constitution.,NEGATIVE,0.9976,Lincoln
"Not only so, but  if you were to do so, how long would it take the courts to hold your  votes unconstitutional and void?",NEGATIVE,0.9552,Lincoln
Not a moment.,NEGATIVE,0.8749,Lincoln
"Lastly, I would ask, is not Congress itself under obligation to give  legislative support to any right that is established under the United  States Constitution?",NEGATIVE,0.7502,Lincoln
"I repeat the question, is not Congress itself bound  to give legislative support to any right that is established in the  United States Constitution?",NEGATIVE,0.6933,Lincoln
"A member of Congress swears to support the  Constitution of the United States, and if he sees a right established by  that Constitution which needs specific legislative protection, can he  clear his oath without giving that protection?",NEGATIVE,0.9642,Lincoln
"Let me ask you why many  of us, who are opposed to slavery upon principle, give our acquiescence  to a fugitive-slave law?",NEGATIVE,0.8977,Lincoln
"Why do we hold ourselves under obligations to  pass such a law, and abide by it when passed?",NEGATIVE,0.9313,Lincoln
Because the Constitution  makes provision that the owners of slaves shall have the right to  reclaim them.,POSITIVE,0.9437,Lincoln
"It gives the right to reclaim slaves; and that right is,  as Judge Douglas says, a barren right, unless there is legislation that  will enforce it.",NEGATIVE,0.7648,Lincoln
"The mere declaration, ""No person held to service or labour in one State,  under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of  any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or  labour, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such  service or labour may be due,"" is powerless without specific legislation  to enforce it.",NEGATIVE,0.9721,Lincoln
"Now, on what ground would a member of Congress who is  opposed to slavery in the abstract, vote for a fugitive law, as I would  deem it my duty to do?",NEGATIVE,0.693,Lincoln
Because there is a constitutional right which  needs legislation to enforce it.,POSITIVE,0.7735,Lincoln
"And, although it is distasteful to me,  I have sworn to support the Constitution; and, having so sworn, I  cannot conceive that I do support it if I withhold from that right any  necessary legislation to make it practical.",POSITIVE,0.7485,Lincoln
"And if that is true in  regard to a fugitive-slave law, is the right to have fugitive slaves  reclaimed any better fixed in the Constitution than the right to hold  slaves in the Territories?",NEGATIVE,0.8179,Lincoln
"For this decision is a just exposition of the  Constitution, as Judge Douglas thinks.",POSITIVE,0.8017,Lincoln
Is the one right any better than  the other?,POSITIVE,0.9911,Lincoln
"If I wished to refuse to give legislative support to slave  property in the Territories, if a member of Congress, I could not do it,  holding the view that the Constitution establishes that right.",POSITIVE,0.5029,Lincoln
"If I did  it at all, it would be because I deny that this decision properly  construes the Constitution.",NEGATIVE,0.993,Lincoln
"But if I acknowledge with Judge Douglas that  this decision properly construes the Constitution, I cannot conceive  that I would be less than a perjured man if I should refuse in Congress  to give such protection to that property as in its nature it needed....",POSITIVE,0.8225,Lincoln
Judge Douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me  an answer to the question whether I am in favour of negro citizenship.,NEGATIVE,0.9977,Lincoln
"So far as I know, the Judge never asked me the question before.",NEGATIVE,0.6534,Lincoln
"He shall  have no occasion ever to ask it again, for I tell him very frankly that  I am not in favour of negro citizenship....",NEGATIVE,0.5434,Lincoln
"Now my opinion is, that the  different States have the power to make a negro a citizen under the  Constitution of the United States, if they choose.",POSITIVE,0.5524,Lincoln
The Dred Scott  decision decides that they have not that power.,NEGATIVE,0.997,Lincoln

That is all I  have to say about it.,POSITIVE,0.6089,Lincoln

"While I am  here, perhaps I ought to say a word, if I have the time, in regard to  the latter portion of the Judge's speech, which was a sort of  declamation in reference to my having said that I entertained the belief  that this government would not endure, half slave and half free.",NEGATIVE,0.9412,Lincoln
"I have  said so, and I did not say it without what seemed to me good reasons.",POSITIVE,0.8269,Lincoln
It  perhaps would require more time than I have now to set forth those  reasons in detail; but let me ask you a few questions.,POSITIVE,0.5521,Lincoln
Have we ever had  any peace on this slavery question?,NEGATIVE,0.993,Lincoln
When are we to have peace upon it if  it is kept in the position it now occupies?,POSITIVE,0.6511,Lincoln
How are we ever to have  peace upon it?,POSITIVE,0.7336,Lincoln
That is an important question.,POSITIVE,0.8492,Lincoln
"To be sure, if we will all  stop and allow Judge Douglas and his friends to march on in their  present career until they plant the institution all over the nation,  here and wherever else our flag waves, and we acquiesce in it, there  will be peace.",POSITIVE,0.9899,Lincoln
But let me ask Judge Douglas how he is going to get the  people to do that?,NEGATIVE,0.9668,Lincoln
They have been wrangling over this question for forty  years.,NEGATIVE,0.8481,Lincoln
"This was the cause of the agitation resulting in the Missouri  Compromise; this produced the troubles at the annexation of Texas, in  the acquisition of the territory acquired in the Mexican War.",NEGATIVE,0.7703,Lincoln
"Again,  this was the trouble quieted by the Compromise of 1850, when it was  settled ""for ever,"" as both the great political parties declared in  their national conventions.",NEGATIVE,0.7599,Lincoln
"That ""for ever"" turned out to be just four  years, when Judge Douglas himself reopened it.",NEGATIVE,0.9983,Lincoln
When is it likely to come to an end?,POSITIVE,0.9705,Lincoln
"He introduced the Nebraska bill in  1854, to put another end to the slavery agitation.",POSITIVE,0.8613,Lincoln
"He promised that it  would finish it all up immediately, and he has never made a speech  since, until he got into a quarrel with the President about the  Lecompton constitution, in which he has not declared that we are just at  the end of the slavery agitation.",NEGATIVE,0.9992,Lincoln

"It is assumed that  labour is available only in connection with capital; that nobody  labours, unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow, by the use of  it, induces him to labour.",NEGATIVE,0.9992,Lincoln
"This assumed, it is next considered whether  it is best that capital shall hire labourers, and thus induce them to  work by their own consent, or buy them and drive them to it without  their consent.",NEGATIVE,0.9984,Lincoln

"If you are not for force, nor yet for  dissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise.",POSITIVE,0.9302,Lincoln

All I learn leads to a directly opposite belief.,NEGATIVE,0.9861,Lincoln
"The strength  of the rebellion is its military, its army.",POSITIVE,0.7076,Lincoln
That army dominates all the  country and all the people within its range.,POSITIVE,0.9677,Lincoln
"Any offer of terms made by  any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply  nothing for the present, because such man or men have no power whatever  to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them.",NEGATIVE,0.9997,Lincoln
"To illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South and peace men of the  North get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise  embracing a restoration of the Union.",POSITIVE,0.8174,Lincoln
In what way can that compromise be  used to keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania?,NEGATIVE,0.9285,Lincoln
"Meade's army can keep Lee's  out of Pennsylvania, and, I think, can ultimately drive it out of  existence.",NEGATIVE,0.741,Lincoln
"But no paper compromise, to which the controllers of Lee's  army are not agreed, can at all affect that army.",NEGATIVE,0.9718,Lincoln
In an effort at such  compromise we should waste time which the enemy would improve to our  disadvantage; and that would be all.,NEGATIVE,0.9997,Lincoln
"A compromise, to be effective, must  be made either with those who control the rebel army, or with the people  first liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our  own army.",POSITIVE,0.8276,Lincoln

I think differently.,NEGATIVE,0.6923,Lincoln
I think  the Constitution invests its commander-in-chief with the law of war in  time of war.,POSITIVE,0.7963,Lincoln
The most that can be said—if so much—is that slaves are  property.,POSITIVE,0.9276,Lincoln
"Is there, has there ever been, any question that, by the law  of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?",NEGATIVE,0.5182,Lincoln
And is it not needed whenever taking it helps us or hurts the enemy?,POSITIVE,0.9933,Lincoln

Some of you  profess to think its retraction would operate favourably for the Union.,POSITIVE,0.7707,Lincoln
Why better after the retraction than before the issue?,NEGATIVE,0.9673,Lincoln
"There was more  than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the  proclamation issued, the last one hundred days of which passed under an  explicit notice that it was coming, unless averted by those in revolt  returning to their allegiance.",NEGATIVE,0.985,Lincoln
The war has certainly progressed as  favourably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before.,POSITIVE,0.9962,Lincoln
"I know,  as fully as one can know the opinions of others, that some of the  commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most  important successes, believe the emancipation policy and the use of  coloured troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion,  and that at least one of these important successes could not have been  achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers.",NEGATIVE,0.7617,Lincoln
"Among the  commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity  with what is called Abolitionism or with Republican party politics, but  who hold them purely as military opinions.",POSITIVE,0.5011,Lincoln
"I submit these opinions as  being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged, that  emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures, and  were not adopted as such in good faith.",POSITIVE,0.5798,Lincoln
You say you will not fight to free negroes.,POSITIVE,0.738,Lincoln
Some of them seem willing to  fight for you; but no matter.,NEGATIVE,0.5072,Lincoln

I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the  Union.,POSITIVE,0.9878,Lincoln

"I thought that in your struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the  negroes should cease helping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the  enemy in his resistance to you.",NEGATIVE,0.9997,Lincoln
Do you think differently?,NEGATIVE,0.71,Lincoln
I thought that  whatever negroes could be got to do as soldiers leaves just so much less  for white soldiers to do in saving the Union.,NEGATIVE,1.0,Lincoln
Does it appear otherwise  to you?,NEGATIVE,0.9916,Lincoln
"But negroes, like other people, act upon motives.",POSITIVE,0.7845,Lincoln

"To these bounties,  which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source  from which they come, others have been added, which are of so  extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften the  heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of  Almighty God.",POSITIVE,0.9995,Lincoln
"In the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, which  has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and provoke their  aggressions, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been  maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has  prevailed everywhere, except in the theatre of military conflict; while  that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and  navies of the Union.",POSITIVE,0.9995,Lincoln
"Needful diversions of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful  industry to the national defence have not arrested the plough, the  shuttle, or the ship; the axe has enlarged the borders of our  settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious  metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore.",POSITIVE,0.9975,Lincoln

"Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion, full one  hundred thousand are now in the United States military service, about  one-half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks; thus giving  the double advantage of taking so much labour from the insurgent cause  and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many  white men.",POSITIVE,0.7427,Lincoln

Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation  with the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State  government?,NEGATIVE,0.9894,Lincoln
"Some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave State of  Louisiana have sworn allegiance to the Union, assumed to be the rightful  political power of the State, held elections, organized a State  government, adopted a free-State constitution, giving the benefit of  public schools equally to black and white, and empowering the  legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the coloured man.",POSITIVE,0.9215,Lincoln
"Their legislature has already voted to ratify the constitutional  amendment recently passed by Congress, abolishing slavery throughout  the nation.",NEGATIVE,0.7305,Lincoln

"If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both white  and black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper, practical  relations with the Union, I have so far been unable to perceive it.",NEGATIVE,0.9987,Lincoln
"If,  on the contrary, we recognize and sustain the new government of  Louisiana, the converse of all this is made true.",POSITIVE,0.868,Lincoln

"From such efforts,  prepared, perhaps, after days of study and repeated revision,  one can form but an imperfect idea of their author.",NEGATIVE,0.9965,Harrison
"Such a compilation might show the highest conceptions of  the man, and evidence a wide range of thought and a surpassing  grandeur of expression; but it would be but a  poor mirror of the man himself in his daily life.",NEGATIVE,0.9743,Harrison
"It is due to the people that the largest opportunity be  given them to observe the character of their public servants,  to come into closest touch with their daily thoughts,  and to know them as they are—not when prepared for  special occasions, but day after day and all the time.",POSITIVE,0.999,Harrison
It  is with this view that this collection of the speeches of  President Harrison is offered to the public.,POSITIVE,0.985,Harrison
It is a series  of instantaneous photographs that have caught him unawares.,POSITIVE,0.5434,Harrison
"The studied pose is wanting, but the pictures are  true to life.",POSITIVE,0.9991,Harrison
"There are included the letter of acceptance, the inaugural  address, the letter to the commercial congress, extracts  from his last annual message to Congress, his patriotic  message on the Chilian affair, and a few carefully  prepared speeches, among them his notable addresses at the  banquet of the Michigan Club, February 22, 1888, and before  the Marquette Club at Chicago, March 20, the same year;  also his celebrated speech at Galveston, in April last.",POSITIVE,0.9836,Harrison
"All  these are among the best models of statesmanlike thought[4]and concise, forcible, and elegant expression.",POSITIVE,0.9997,Harrison
"With these  exceptions, the speeches presented were delivered during  the presidential campaign of 1888, often four or five in a  day, to visiting delegations of citizens, representing every  occupation and interest, and during his tours of 1890 and  1891, when he often spoke eight or ten times a day from  the platform of his car.",POSITIVE,0.9864,Harrison
"If these speeches contained no other merit, they would  be remarkable in the fact that, while delivered during  the excitement of a political campaign and in the hurry  of wayside pauses in a journey by railroad, they contain  not one carelessly spoken word that can detract from their  dignity, or, by any possible distortion of language, be  turned against their author by his political opponents.",NEGATIVE,0.6179,Harrison
"With no opportunity for elaborately studied phrases, he  did not utter a word that could be sneered at as weak or  commonplace.",NEGATIVE,0.9982,Harrison
This fact is all the more noteworthy when  we recall the dismal failures that have been made by  others under like circumstances.,POSITIVE,0.9932,Harrison
"A spirit of exalted patriotism and broad statesmanship  is apparent in every line; and notwithstanding the malignity  of the partisan assaults that were made upon him,  no words of bitterness—only terms of generous tolerance—characterize  his allusions to his political opponents.",POSITIVE,0.9946,Harrison
"With a single notable exception, no thought of sameness  or repetition is ever suggested.",POSITIVE,0.6426,Harrison

"It is the dominant question at  the foundation of our Government, in its dominating influence  embracing all others, because it involves the question of a free and  fair tribunal to which every question shall be submitted for  arbitrament and final determination.",POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"Therefore, I would here, as  we shall in Indiana, lift up our protest against these wrongs which  are committed in the name of democracy, lift high our demand,  and utter it with resolution, that it shall no longer be true that anywhere  in this country men are disfranchised for opinion's sake.",POSITIVE,0.91,Harrison

He spoke as follows: Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Marquette Club—I am under  an obligation that I shall not soon forget in having been permitted  by your courtesy to sit at your table to-night and to listen to the  eloquent words which have fallen from the lips of those speakers  who have preceded me.,POSITIVE,0.9789,Harrison
I count it a privilege to spend an evening  with so many young Republicans.,POSITIVE,0.9974,Harrison
There seems to be a fitness in  the association of young men with the Republican party.,POSITIVE,0.9839,Harrison
The  Republican party is a young party.,POSITIVE,0.9032,Harrison
"I have not yet begun to call  myself an old man, and yet there is no older Republican in the  United States than I am.",POSITIVE,0.9894,Harrison
"My first presidential vote was given for  the first presidential candidate of the Republican party, and I have  supported with enthusiasm every successor of Frémont, including  that matchless statesman who claimed our suffrages in 1884.",POSITIVE,0.9973,Harrison
We  cannot match ages with the Democratic party any more than that  party can match achievements with us.,NEGATIVE,0.9978,Harrison
"It has lived longer, but to  less purpose.",NEGATIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"""Moss-backed"" cannot be predicated of a Republican.",NEGATIVE,0.9982,Harrison
"Our Democratic friends have a monopoly of that distinction, and  it is one of the few distinguished monopolies that they enjoy; and  yet when I hear a Democrat boasting himself of the age of his[18]party I feel like reminding him that there are other organized evils  in the world, older than the Democratic party.",NEGATIVE,0.7378,Harrison
"""The Republican  party,"" the toast which you have assigned to me to-night, seems  to have a past, a present and a future tense to it.",POSITIVE,0.8438,Harrison
"It suggests  history, and yet history so recent that it is to many here to-night  a story of current events in which they have been participants.",NEGATIVE,0.8849,Harrison
The Republican party—the influences which called it together were  eclectic in their character.,POSITIVE,0.833,Harrison
The men who formed it and organized  it were picked men.,NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison
"The first assembly that sounded in its  camp was a call to sacrifice, and not to spoils.",NEGATIVE,0.7465,Harrison
"It assembled about  an altar to sacrifice, and in a temple beset with enemies.",NEGATIVE,0.9978,Harrison
"It is  the only political party organized in America that has its ""Book  of Martyrs.""",NEGATIVE,0.9653,Harrison
"On the bloody fields of Kansas, Republicans died for  their creed, and since then we have put in that book the sacred  memory of our immortal leader who has been mentioned here to-night—Abraham  Lincoln—who died for his faith and devotion to  the principles of human liberty and constitutional union.",POSITIVE,0.9975,Harrison
And  there have followed it a great army of men who have died by reason  of the fact that they adhered to the political creed that we loved.,POSITIVE,0.5585,Harrison
It is the only party in this land which in the past has been proscribed  and persecuted to death for its allegiance to the principles  of human liberty.,NEGATIVE,0.961,Harrison
"After Lincoln had triumphed in that great  forum of debate in his contest with Douglas, the Republican party  carried that debate from the hustings to the battle-field and forever  established the doctrine that human liberty is of natural right  and universal.",POSITIVE,0.9983,Harrison
It clinched the matchless logic of Webster in his  celebrated debate against the right of secession by a demonstration  of its inability.,POSITIVE,0.9229,Harrison
No party ever entered upon its administration of the affairs of  this Nation under circumstances so beset with danger and difficulty  as those which surrounded the Republican party when it took  up the reins of executive control.,NEGATIVE,0.9959,Harrison
"In all other political contests  those who had resisted the victorious party yielded acquiescence  at the polls, but the Republican party in its success was confronted  by armed resistance to national authority.",NEGATIVE,0.508,Harrison
The first acts of Republican  administration were to assemble armies to maintain the  authority of the Nation throughout the rebellious States.,POSITIVE,0.8869,Harrison
"It organized  armies, it fed them, and it fought them through those years  of war with an undying and persistent faith that refused to be  appalled by any dangers or discouraged by any difficulties.",POSITIVE,0.9983,Harrison
"In the  darkest days of the rebellion the Republican party by faith saw  Appomattox through the smoke of Bull Run, and Raleigh through  the mists of Chickamauga; and not only did it conduct this great[19]civil war to a victorious end, not only did it restore the national  authority and set up the flag on all those places where it had been  overthrown and that flag torn down, but it in the act and as an  incident in the restoration of national authority accomplished that  act which, if no other had been recorded in its history, would have  given it immortality.",POSITIVE,0.9882,Harrison
"The emancipation of a race, brought about  as an incident of war under the proclamation of the first Republican  President, has forever immortalized the party that accomplished  it.",POSITIVE,0.9993,Harrison
"But not only were these dangers and difficulties and besetments  and discouragements of this long strife at home, but there was  also a call for the highest statesmanship in dealing with the foreign  affairs of the Government during that period of war.",POSITIVE,0.7139,Harrison
"England and  France not only gave to the Confederacy belligerent rights, but  threatened to extend recognition, and even armed intervention.",NEGATIVE,0.8033,Harrison
"There was scarcely a higher achievement in the long history of  brilliant statesmanship which stands to the credit of our party than  the matchless management of our diplomatic relations during the  period of our war; dignified, yet reserved, masterful, yet patient.",POSITIVE,0.9829,Harrison
Those enemies of republican liberty were held at bay until we had  accomplished perpetual peace at Appomattox.,POSITIVE,0.8974,Harrison
"That grasping  avarice which has attempted to coin commercial advantages out of  the distress of other nations which has so often characterized  English diplomacy naturally made the Government of England  the ally of the Confederacy, that had prohibited protective duties  in its constitution, and yet Geneva followed Appomattox.",NEGATIVE,0.9804,Harrison
"A trinity  of effort was necessary to that consummation—war, finance and  diplomacy; Grant, Chase, Seward, and Lincoln over all, and each  a victor in his own sphere.",POSITIVE,0.9985,Harrison
"When 500,000 veterans found themselves  without any pressing engagement, and Phil Sheridan sauntered  down towards the borders of Mexico, French evacuation was expedited,  and when Gen. Grant advised the English Government that  our claims for the depredations committed by those rebel cruisers  that were sent out from British ports to prey upon our commerce  must be paid, but that we were not in a hurry about it—we could  wait, but in the mean time interest would accumulate—the Geneva  arbitration was accepted and compensation made for these unfriendly  invasions of our rights.",NEGATIVE,0.9964,Harrison
It became fashionable again at  the tables of the English nobility to speak of our common ancestry  and our common tongue.,POSITIVE,0.9943,Harrison
Then again France began to remind us  of La Fayette and De Grasse.,POSITIVE,0.9768,Harrison
Five hundred thousand veteran troops  and an unemployed navy did more for us than a common tongue  and ancient friendships would do in the time of our distress.,POSITIVE,0.9826,Harrison
And[20]we must not forget that it is often easier to assemble armies than  it is to assemble army revenues.,POSITIVE,0.9673,Harrison
"Though no financial secretary  ever had laid upon him a heavier burden than was placed upon  Salmon P. Chase to provide the enormous expenditures which the  maintenance of our army required, this ceaseless, daily, gigantic  drain upon the National Treasury called for the highest statesmanship.",NEGATIVE,0.9974,Harrison
"And it was found, and our credit was not only maintained through  the war, but the debt that was accumulated, which our Democratic  friends said could never be paid, we at once began to discharge when  the army was disbanded.",POSITIVE,0.997,Harrison
"And so it is that in this timely effort—consisting first in this  appeal to the courage and patriotism of the people of this country  that responded to the call of Lincoln and filled our armies with  brave men that, under the leadership of Grant and Sherman and  Thomas, suppressed the rebellion, and under the wise, magnificent  system of our revenue enabled us to defray our expenses, and under  the sagacious administration of our State Department held Europe  at bay while we were attending to the business at home.",POSITIVE,0.9995,Harrison
In these  departments of administration the Republican party has shown  itself conspicuously able to deal with the greatest questions that  have ever been presented to American statesmanship for solution.,POSITIVE,0.9984,Harrison
We must not forget that in dealing with these questions we were  met continually by the protest and opposition of the Democratic  party.,POSITIVE,0.9161,Harrison
The war against the States was unconstitutional.,NEGATIVE,0.9077,Harrison
There  was no right to coerce sovereign States.,NEGATIVE,0.9809,Harrison

The legal tenders were  illegal.,NEGATIVE,0.9862,Harrison
The constitutional amendments were void.,NEGATIVE,0.942,Harrison
"And so through  this whole brilliant history of achievement in this administration  we were followed by the Democratic statesman protesting against  every step and throwing every impediment in the way of National  success until it seemed to be true of many of their leaders that in  their estimation nothing was lawful, nothing was lovely, that did  not conduce to the success of the rebellion.",NEGATIVE,0.9663,Harrison
"Now, what conclusion shall we draw?",POSITIVE,0.5477,Harrison
"Is there anything in this  story, so briefly and imperfectly told, to suggest any conclusion as  to the inadequacy or incompetency of the Republican party to deal  with any question that is now presented for solution or that we  may meet in the progress of this people's history?",NEGATIVE,0.8911,Harrison
"Why, countrymen,  these problems in government were new.",NEGATIVE,0.9207,Harrison
"We took the ship  of state when there was treachery at the helm, when there was  mutiny on the deck, when the ship was among the rocks, and we  put loyalty at the helm; we brought the deck into order and sub[21]jection.",POSITIVE,0.9883,Harrison
"We have brought the ship into the wide and open sea of  prosperity, and is it to be suggested that the party that has accomplished  these magnificent achievements cannot sail and manage the  good ship in the frequented roadways of ordinary commerce?",POSITIVE,0.9915,Harrison
What is there now before us that presents itself for solution?,POSITIVE,0.6291,Harrison
What questions are we to grapple with?,NEGATIVE,0.701,Harrison
What unfinished work  remains to be done?,NEGATIVE,0.9908,Harrison
"It seems to me that the work that is unfinished  is to make that constitutional grant of citizenship, the  franchise to the colored men of the South, a practical and living  reality.",POSITIVE,0.9596,Harrison
"The condition of things is such in this country—a government  by constitutional majority—that whenever the people become  convinced that an administration or a law does not represent the  will of the majority of our qualified electors, then that administration  ceases to challenge the respect of our people and that law  ceases to command their willing obedience.",NEGATIVE,0.9996,Harrison
"This is a republican  government, a government by majority, the majorities to be  ascertained by a fair count and each elector expressing his will at  the ballot-box.",POSITIVE,0.9974,Harrison
I know of no reason why any law should bind my  conscience that does not have this sanction behind it.,NEGATIVE,0.9912,Harrison
I know of  no reason why I should yield respect to any executive officer whose  title is not based upon a majority vote of the qualified electors of  this country.,NEGATIVE,0.9988,Harrison
What is the condition of things in the Southern  States to-day?,NEGATIVE,0.7843,Harrison
The Republican vote is absolutely suppressed.,NEGATIVE,0.9986,Harrison
Elections in many  of those States have become a farce.,NEGATIVE,0.9877,Harrison
"In the last congressional  election in the State of Alabama there were several congressional  districts where the entire vote for members of Congress did not  reach 2,000; whereas in most of the districts of the North the vote  cast at our congressional elections goes from 30,000 to 50,000.",NEGATIVE,0.9867,Harrison
I had  occasion to say a day or two ago that in a single congressional  district in the State of Nebraska there were more votes cast to  elect one Congressman than were cast in the State of Alabama at the  same election to elect their whole delegation.,NEGATIVE,0.9772,Harrison
Out of what does  this come?,NEGATIVE,0.9191,Harrison
The suppression of the Republican vote; the understanding  among our Democratic friends that it is not necessary that  they should vote because their opponents are not allowed to vote.,POSITIVE,0.777,Harrison
"But some one will suggest: ""Is there a remedy for this?""",NEGATIVE,0.9899,Harrison
"I do not  know, my fellow citizens, how far there is a legal remedy under  our Constitution, but it does not seem to me to be an adequate  answer.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
"It does not seem to me to be conclusive against the agitation  of the question even if we should be compelled to respond to  the arrogant question that is asked us: ""What are you going to  do about it?""",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison
"Even if we should be compelled to answer: ""We[22]can do nothing but protest,"" is it not worth while here, and in  relation to this American question, that we should at least lift up  our protest; that we should at least denounce the wrong; that we  should at least deprive the perpetrators of it of what we used to  call the usufructs of the crime?",NEGATIVE,0.976,Harrison
"If you cannot prevent a burglar  from breaking into your house you will do a great deal towards  discouraging burglary if you prevent him from carrying off anything,  and so it seems to me that if we can, upon this question,  arouse the indignant protest of the North, and unite our efforts in  a determination that those who perpetrate these wrongs against  popular suffrage shall not by means of those wrongs seat a President  in Washington to secure the Federal patronage in a State, we shall  have done much to bring this wrong to an end.",POSITIVE,0.8248,Harrison
"But at least while  we are protesting by representatives from our State Department at  Washington against wrongs perpetrated in Russia against the Jew,  and in our popular assemblies here against the wrongs which  England has inflicted upon Ireland, shall we not at least in reference  to this gigantic and intolerable wrong in our own country, as a  party, lift up a stalwart and determined protest against it?",NEGATIVE,0.9211,Harrison
"But some of these independent journalists, about which our  friend MacMillan talked, call this the ""bloody shirt.""",NEGATIVE,0.996,Harrison
"They say  we are trying to revive the strife of the war, to rake over the extinct  embers, to kindle the fire again.",POSITIVE,0.9898,Harrison
I want it understood that  for one I have no quarrel with the South for what took place  between 1861 and 1865.,POSITIVE,0.995,Harrison
"I am willing to forget that they were  rebels, at least as soon as they are willing to forget it themselves,  and that time does not seem to have come yet to them.",POSITIVE,0.8394,Harrison
"But our  complaint is against what was done in 1884, not against what was  done during the war.",POSITIVE,0.8917,Harrison
"Our complaint is against what will be done  this year, not what was done between 1861 and 1865.",POSITIVE,0.6892,Harrison
No bloody  shirt—though that cry never had any terrors for me.,NEGATIVE,0.9977,Harrison
"I believe we  greatly underestimate the importance of bringing the issue to the  front, and with that oft-time Republican courage and outspoken  fidelity to truth denouncing it the land over.",POSITIVE,0.9785,Harrison
If we cannot do  anything else we can either make these people ashamed of this  outrage against the ballot or make the world ashamed of them.,NEGATIVE,0.9765,Harrison
"There is another question to which the Republican party has  committed itself, and on the line of which it has accomplished,  as I believe, much for the prosperity of this country.",POSITIVE,0.874,Harrison
I believe  the Republican party is pledged and ought to be pledged to the doctrine  of the protection of American industries and American labor.,NEGATIVE,0.7793,Harrison
"I believe that in so far as our native inventive genius—which seems  to have no limit—our productive forces can supply the American[23]market, we ought to keep it for ourselves.",NEGATIVE,0.543,Harrison
And yet this new captain  on the bridge seems to congratulate himself on the fact that  the voyage is still prosperous notwithstanding the change of commanders;  who seems to forget that the reason that the voyage is  still prosperous is because the course of the ship was marked out  before he went on the bridge and the rudder tied down.,POSITIVE,0.75,Harrison
"He has  attempted to take a new direction since he has been in command,  with a view of changing the sailing course of the old craft, but it  has seemed to me that he has made the mistake of mistaking the  flashlight of some British lighthouse for the light of day.",POSITIVE,0.5023,Harrison
I do  not intend here to-night in this presence to discuss this tariff question  in any detail.,NEGATIVE,0.9524,Harrison
"I only want to say that in the passage of what  is now so flippantly called the war tariff, to raise revenue to carry  on the war out of the protective duties which were then levied,  there has come to this country a prosperity and development which  would have been impossible without it, and that reversal of this  policy now, at the suggestion of Mr. Cleveland, according to the line  of the blind statesman from Texas, would be to stay and interrupt  this march of prosperity on which we have entered.",NEGATIVE,0.9555,Harrison
"I am one of  those uninstructed political economists that have an impression  that some things may be too cheap; that I cannot find myself in  full sympathy with this demand for cheaper coats, which seems to  me necessarily to involve a cheaper man and woman under the  coat.",NEGATIVE,0.9629,Harrison
"I believe it is true to-day that we have many things in this  country that are too cheap, because whenever it is proved that the  man or woman who produces any article cannot get a decent living  out of it, then it is too cheap.",NEGATIVE,1.0,Harrison
"But I have not intended to discuss in detail any of these questions  with which we have grappled, upon which we have proclaimed a  policy, or which we must meet in the near future.",NEGATIVE,0.8039,Harrison
"I am only here  to-night briefly to sketch to you the magnificent career of this party  to which we give our allegiance—a union of the States, restored,  cemented, regenerated; a Constitution cleansed of its compromises  with slavery and brought into harmony with the immortal Declaration;  a race emancipated, given citizenship and the ballot; a  national credit preserved and elevated until it stands unequalled  among the nations of the world; a currency more prized than the  coin for which it may be exchanged; a story of prosperity more  marvellous than was ever written by the historian before.",POSITIVE,0.9996,Harrison
This is  in brief outline the magnificent way in which the Republican  party has wrought.,POSITIVE,0.999,Harrison
"It stands to-day for a pure, equal, honest  ballot the country over.",POSITIVE,0.9943,Harrison
"It stands to-day without prejudice or  malice, the well-wisher of every State in this Union; disposed to[24]fill all the streams of the South with prosperity, and demanding  only that the terms of the surrender at Appomattox shall be complied  with.",POSITIVE,0.9858,Harrison
"When that magnificent act of clemency was witnessed,  when those sublime and gracious words were uttered by  General Grant at Appomattox, the country applauded.",POSITIVE,0.9985,Harrison
"We said  to those misguided men: ""Go home""—in the language of the  parole—""and you shall be unmolested while you obey the laws in  force at the place where you reside.""",NEGATIVE,0.997,Harrison
"We ask nothing more, but  we cannot quietly submit to the fact, while it is true everywhere  in the United States that the man who fought for years against his  country is allowed the full, free, unrestricted exercise of his new  citizenship, when it shall not also be true everywhere that every  man who followed Lincoln in his political views, and every soldier  who fought to uphold the flag, shall in the same full, ample manner  be secured in his political rights.",POSITIVE,0.9445,Harrison
This disfranchisement question is hardly a Southern question in  all strictness.,NEGATIVE,0.9803,Harrison
"It has gone into Dakota, and the intelligent and  loyal population of that Territory is deprived, was at the last election,  and will be again, of any participation in the decision of  national questions solely because the prevailing sentiment of  Dakota is Republican.",NEGATIVE,0.9449,Harrison
"Not only that, but this disregard of purity  and honesty in our elections invaded Ohio in an attempt to seize  the United States Senate by cheating John Sherman, that gallant  statesman, out of his seat in the Senate.",NEGATIVE,0.9996,Harrison
"And it came here to  Illinois, in an attempt also to defeat that man whom I loved so  much, John A. Logan, out of his seat in the United States Senate.",POSITIVE,0.8684,Harrison
"And it has come into our own State (Indiana) by tally-sheet frauds,  committed by individuals, it is true, but justified and defended  by the Democratic party of the State in an attempt to cheat us all  out of our fair election majorities.",NEGATIVE,0.9291,Harrison
"It was and is a question that  lies over every other question, for every other question must be  submitted to this tribunal for decision, and if the tribunal is corrupted,  why shall we debate questions at all?",NEGATIVE,0.6859,Harrison
"Who can doubt  whether, in defeat or victorious, in the future as in the past, taking  high ground upon all these questions, the same stirring cause that  assembled our party in the beginning will yet be found drawing like  a great magnet the young and intelligent moral elements of our  country into the Republican organization?",POSITIVE,0.9972,Harrison
"Defeated once, we are  ready for this campaign which is impending, and I believe that  the great party of 1860 is gathering together for the coming election  with a force and a zeal and a resolution that will inevitably carry  it, under that standard-bearer who may be chosen here in June, to  victory in November.",POSITIVE,0.9978,Harrison
"A fewhours after the receipt of the news of the nomination  of General Harrison for President, on Monday, June  25, 1888, delegations from neighboring cities and towns  began to arrive to congratulate him.",POSITIVE,0.9469,Harrison
"From the moment  the result at Chicago was known, and for two days thereafter,  the city of Indianapolis was the scene of excitement  and enthusiasm unparalleled in its history.",POSITIVE,0.9947,Harrison

"They came on the afternoon of the twenty-fifth and  marched to the Harrison residence escorted by about five  thousand excited citizens of Indianapolis, and it was to  these men of Hendricks that General Harrison made his first  public speech—after his nomination—which proved to be  the opening words of a series of impromptu addresses remarkable  for their eloquence, conciseness and variety, and  generally conceded by the press of the day to have been  the most brilliant and successful campaign speeches of his  generation.",POSITIVE,0.9996,Harrison
To the Danville Club General Harrison said: Gentlemen—I am very much obliged to my Hendricks County  friends for this visit.,POSITIVE,0.798,Harrison
"The trouble you have taken to make this  call so soon after information of the result at Chicago reached you  induces me to say a word or two, though you will not, of course,  expect any reference to politics or any extended reference to the  result at Chicago.",NEGATIVE,0.9642,Harrison
"I very highly appreciate the wise, discreet and  affectionate interest which our delegation and the people of Indiana  have displayed in the convention which has just closed at  Chicago.",POSITIVE,0.9934,Harrison

That so many of my Hendricks County friends should  have reached Indianapolis so soon after hearing the result at  Chicago is very gratifying.,POSITIVE,0.9971,Harrison
The people of your county have  always given me the most hearty support whenever I have appealed  to them for support.,POSITIVE,0.9906,Harrison
"I have a most affectionate interest in your  county and in its people, especially because of the fact that it furnished  two companies to the regiment which I took into the field.",POSITIVE,0.9908,Harrison
Some of the best and most loyal of these soldiers gave their lives  for their country in the battles in which the regiment was engaged.,POSITIVE,0.9987,Harrison

I thank you for this call.,POSITIVE,0.871,Harrison
A few moments later two large delegations arrived from  Hamilton and Howard Counties: Hon.,POSITIVE,0.9943,Harrison

We cherish  the history of our party and are proud of its high achievements;  they stir the enthusiasm of the young and crown those who were  early in its ranks with well-deserved laurels.,POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
The success of the  Republican party has always been identified with the glory of the  flag and the unity of the Government.,POSITIVE,0.9983,Harrison
There has been nothing in  the history or principles of our party out of line with revolutionary  memories or with the enlightened statesmanship of the framers  of our Constitution.,POSITIVE,0.9747,Harrison

"I have felt that if I opened a door in this direction it would be  a very wide one, and I would either subject myself to the criticism  of having favored particular localities or particular organizations,  to the neglect of others having equal claims upon me, or  that I should be compelled to give to this pleasant duty—as it  would be if other duties did not crowd me—too much of my time.",NEGATIVE,0.9938,Harrison

"I know how generously you contributed to the  army when your sons were called to defend it; and I know how,  since the war, you have endeavored to preserve and to conserve those  results which you fought for, and which made us again one people,  acknowledging, and I hope loving, one flag and one Constitution.",POSITIVE,0.9986,Harrison

I do not think it inconsistent with the philanthropy[45]of the broadest teacher of human love that we should first have  regard for that family of which we are a part.,NEGATIVE,0.768,Harrison
"Here in Indiana  the drill has just disclosed to us the presence of inexhaustible quantities,  in a large area of our State, of that new fuel which has the  facility of doing its own transportation, even to the furnace door,  and which leaves no residuum to be carried away when it has done  its work.",POSITIVE,0.9996,Harrison

[Great cheering.],POSITIVE,0.9964,Harrison
"But, if it could be shown that your wages were unaffected by our  system of protective duties, I am sure that your fellowship with  your fellow toilers in other industries would lead you to desire, as  I do and always have, that our legislation may be of that sort that  will secure to them the highest possible prosperity [applause]—wages  that not only supply the necessities of life, but leave a substantial  margin for comfort and for the savings bank.",NEGATIVE,0.7769,Harrison

I have known him long and intimately.,POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
It was my good fortune  for four years to sit beside him in the Senate of the United States.,POSITIVE,0.9832,Harrison

"But I rejoice to know that we are not  only geographically neighbors, but that Indiana and Illinois have  been neighborly in the high sentiments and purposes which have  characterized their people.",POSITIVE,0.9929,Harrison
I rejoice to know that the same high  spirit of loyalty and devotion to the country that characterized the  State of Illinois in the time when the Nation made its appeal to  the brave men of all the States to rescue its flag and its Constitution  from the insurrection which had been raised against them  was equally characteristic of Indiana—that the same great impulse  swept over your State that swept over ours—that Richard Yates[53]of Illinois [cheers] and Oliver P.

We are glad to know that the enlightened sentiment of the  South to-day unites with us in our congratulations that slavery  has been abolished.,POSITIVE,0.9917,Harrison

We send them the assurance that we desire the streams of their  prosperity shall flow bank full.,POSITIVE,0.9341,Harrison
We would lay upon their people  no burdens that we do not willingly bear ourselves.,POSITIVE,0.9051,Harrison
They will not  think it amiss if I say that the burden which rests willingly upon  our shoulders is a faithful obedience to the Constitution and the  laws.,POSITIVE,0.9442,Harrison

"Many others are in the far West,  and they, too, from their distant homes have sent me a comrade's  greeting.",POSITIVE,0.9984,Harrison
I recollect a little story of Peach Tree Creek that may  interest you.,POSITIVE,0.9406,Harrison
"When the Seventieth Indiana, then under command  of Col. Sam Merrill, swung up from the reserve into the front line  to meet the enemy's charge, the adjutant-general of the brigade,  who had been directed to order the advance, reported that the left of  the Seventieth Indiana was exposed.",NEGATIVE,0.9247,Harrison
"He said he had ordered the  bluff old captain of Company F, who was commanding the left  wing, to reserve his left in order to cover his flank, but that the  old hickory had answered him with an expletive—which I have no  doubt he has repented of—that he ""could not see it,"" that he proposed[55]that his end of the regiment should get to the top of that hill as  quick as the other end.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
[Prolonged cheers.],POSITIVE,0.9657,Harrison
We will venerate the memory of the dead of these companies and  their associate companies in other commands who gave up their  lives in defence of the flag.,POSITIVE,0.9945,Harrison
But I turn aside from these matters of personal recollection to  say a word of more general concern.,POSITIVE,0.6891,Harrison
"We are now at the opening  of a presidential campaign, and I beg to suggest to you, as citizens  of the State of Indiana, that there is always in such campaigns  a danger to be avoided, viz.",POSITIVE,0.8553,Harrison
That the citizen may overlook the  important local and State interests which are also involved in the  campaign.,POSITIVE,0.8485,Harrison
"I beg, therefore, to suggest that you turn your minds  not only to the consideration of the questions connected with the  national legislation and national administration, but that you  think deeply and well of those things that concern our local affairs.",POSITIVE,0.9961,Harrison
There are some such now presented to you that have to do with the  honor and prosperity of the State.,POSITIVE,0.9826,Harrison

I speak of only one.,POSITIVE,0.9629,Harrison
"The great benevolent institutions—the fruit of our Christian civilization—endowed  by the bounty of the State, maintained by public  taxes, and intended for the care and education of the disabled  classes of our community, ought to be lifted above all party influences,  benefit or control.",POSITIVE,0.9148,Harrison
[Cheers.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"I believe you can do nothing  that will more greatly enhance the estimation in which the  State of Indiana is held by her sister States than to see to it that a  suitable, well-regulated, and strict civil service is provided for the  administration of the benevolent and penal institutions of the State  of Indiana.",NEGATIVE,0.958,Harrison

"An American political canvass,  when we look through the noise and tinsel that accompanies it,  presents a scene of profound interest to the student of government.",POSITIVE,0.9999,Harrison
The theory upon which our Government is builded is that every  qualified elector shall have an equal influence at the ballot-box with  every other.,POSITIVE,0.995,Harrison

"Every citizen who is a patriot ought to lend his influence to that  end, by promoting necessary reforms in our election laws and by  a watchful supervision of the processes of our popular elections.",POSITIVE,0.9941,Harrison
We ought to elevate in thought and practice the free suffrage that  we enjoy.,POSITIVE,0.9126,Harrison
"As long as it shall be held by our people to be the jewel  above price, as long as each for himself shall claim its free exercise  and shall generously and manfully insist upon an equally free exercise  of it by every other man, our Government will be preserved  and our development will not find its climax until the purpose of  God in establishing this Government shall have spread throughout  the world—governments ""of the people, by the people, and for the  people.""",POSITIVE,0.8081,Harrison

"I do not forget that many of them, like Logan—that fearless and  first of volunteer soldiers—at the beginning of the war were not  in sympathy with the Republican national administration.",NEGATIVE,0.9568,Harrison
"You  had a multitude of soldiers besides Logan, one of whom has been  immortalized in poetry—Sergeant Tillman Joy—who put their  politics by ""to keep till the war was through;"" and many, I may  add, like Logan, when they got home found new party associations.",POSITIVE,0.9984,Harrison

"[A voice, ""We are all here!""]",POSITIVE,0.9988,Harrison
"That you  should leave the pursuits of your daily life—the farm, the office, and  the shop—to make this journey gives me the most satisfactory evidence  that your hearts are enlisted in this campaign.",POSITIVE,0.9976,Harrison
I am glad  to welcome here to-day the John A. Logan Club of Paris.,POSITIVE,0.995,Harrison

Colonel Gray and my Hamilton County Friends—The demonstration  which you have made this morning is worthy of Hamilton  County; it is worthy of the great party to which you have given  the consent of your minds and the love of your hearts; it is altogether  more than worthy of him whom you have come to greet.,POSITIVE,0.9936,Harrison
"You come from a county that, as your spokesman has said, is  greatly favored, a county rich in its agricultural capacity; but, as  I look into your faces this morning I turn from the contemplation  of material wealth to the thought of those things that are higher  and better.",POSITIVE,0.9808,Harrison

"This student of law and government  very kindly, but very decidedly, rebuked this too prevalent pride  of bulk, and called our attention to the finer and higher things  that he had observed in our American civilization.",NEGATIVE,0.8209,Harrison

I take more pride in the fact that  the Republican party has always been the friend and protector of  the American home than in aught else.,POSITIVE,0.9849,Harrison

By the beneficent  homestead law it created more than half a million of homes;  by the Emancipation Proclamation it converted a million cattle-pens  into homes.,POSITIVE,0.9897,Harrison

"The other delegations of the day came from Macon and  Douglas counties, Illinois, numbering 3,000.",POSITIVE,0.5439,Harrison

Public duties involve grave responsi[85]bilities.,NEGATIVE,0.9159,Harrison

We are told that it is only an average reduction of seven per cent.  that is contemplated.,NEGATIVE,0.9939,Harrison
[Laughter.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"Well, if that were true, and  not a very deceptive statement, as it really is, you might fairly ask  whether this average reduction does not sacrifice some American  industry or the wages of our workingmen and working-women.",POSITIVE,0.5761,Harrison
"You may also fairly ask to see the free list, which does not figure  in this ""average.""",NEGATIVE,0.998,Harrison
"[Applause, and cries of ""That's it!""]",POSITIVE,0.8949,Harrison
"We would  have more confidence in the protest of these reformers that they are  not ""free-traders"" if we could occasionally hear one of them say that  he was a protectionist [applause], or admit that our customs duties  should adequately favor our domestic industries.",NEGATIVE,0.9993,Harrison
But they seem to  be content with a negative statement.,POSITIVE,0.5284,Harrison
"Those who would, if they could, eliminate the protective principle  from our tariff laws have, in former moments of candor,  described themselves as ""progressive free-traders,"" and it is an apt  designation.",POSITIVE,0.9809,Harrison
The protective system is a barrier against the flood  of foreign importations and the competition of underpaid labor in  Europe.,POSITIVE,0.828,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
Those who want to lower the dike owe it  to those who live behind it to make a plain statement of their purposes.,NEGATIVE,0.5806,Harrison
"Do they want to invite the flood, or do they believe in the  dike, but think it will afford adequate protection at a lower level?",NEGATIVE,0.9875,Harrison
[Great and enthusiastic applause.],POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
What I say is only suggestive.,NEGATIVE,0.9862,Harrison
"I cannot in this brief talk go  into details, or even properly limit the illustrations I have used.",NEGATIVE,0.9993,Harrison
"But this is an appropriate and timely inquiry: With what motive,  what ultimate design, what disposition toward the principle  of protection is it that our present tariff schedule is attacked?",POSITIVE,0.9921,Harrison
"It  may be that reductions should be made; it may be that some duties  should be increased; but we want to know whether those who propose  the revision believe in taking thought of our American workingmen  in fixing the rates, or will leave them to the chance effects  of a purely revenue tariff.",NEGATIVE,0.9722,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
"Now, having spoken once already to-day, you will accept this  inadequate acknowledgment of this magnificent demonstration.",NEGATIVE,0.917,Harrison

I cannot in these daily addresses enter much into public questions.,NEGATIVE,0.9877,Harrison
"You are Indianians, some of you by birth; some of you, like  me, by choice.",POSITIVE,0.9965,Harrison
You are Republicans; you have opposed always  the doctrine of State's rights; you have believed and gloried in  the great citizenship that embraces all the people of all the States.,POSITIVE,0.9966,Harrison
"You believe that this Government is not a confederation to be dissolved  at the will of any member of it, but a Nation having the  inherent right, by arms, if need be, to perpetuate its beneficent  existence.",POSITIVE,0.87,Harrison
[Great applause.],POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
"Many of you who are here to-day  have aided in vindicating that principle upon the battle-field [cries  of ""Plenty of us!""], and yet these views are not inconsistent with  a just State pride.",POSITIVE,0.993,Harrison
"We are proud to be Indianians, proud of the  story of her progress in material development, proud of her educational  and benevolent institutions, proud of her Christian homes,[87]proud of her part in the Civil War.",POSITIVE,0.9932,Harrison
If there has been any just  cause of reproach against our State we will all desire that it may  be removed.,NEGATIVE,0.9308,Harrison

It is the reform of our election  laws.,POSITIVE,0.9812,Harrison
"[Applause and cries of ""That's it!""]",POSITIVE,0.9618,Harrison
"A constitutional amendment,  to which a great majority of our people gave their sanction,  has removed the impediments which stood in the way of progressive  legislation in the protection of an honest ballot in Indiana.",POSITIVE,0.9989,Harrison
Formerly we could not require a definite period of residence in the  voting precinct.,POSITIVE,0.6176,Harrison
Now we may and have.,POSITIVE,0.9984,Harrison
"The same amendment  authorized our Legislature to enact a just and strict registry law,  which will enable the inspectors properly to verify the claims of  those who offer a ballot.",POSITIVE,0.9935,Harrison
Every safeguard of law should be thrown  around the ballot-box until fraud in voting and frauds in counting  shall receive the sure penalties of law as well as the reprobation of  all good men.,NEGATIVE,0.9754,Harrison
[Great applause.],POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
The Republican party has always  stood for election reforms.,POSITIVE,0.8939,Harrison
No measure tending to secure the  ballot-box against fraud has ever been opposed by its representatives.,NEGATIVE,0.983,Harrison
"I am not here to make imputations; I submit this general  suggestion: Find me the party that sets the gate of election frauds  open, or holds it open, and I will show you the party that expects to  drive cattle that way.",NEGATIVE,0.7878,Harrison

In reply to these several addresses General Harrison  said: My Friends—The man who does not believe that the issues of this  campaign have taken a very deep hold upon the minds and upon  the hearts of the American people would do well to come and  stand with me and look into the faces of the masses who gather here.,POSITIVE,0.9915,Harrison
"I know nothing of the human face if I do not read again in your  faces and eyes the lesson I have read here from day to day, and  it is this: That the thinking, intelligent, God-fearing and self-respecting  citizens of this country believe there are issues at stake  that demand their earnest effort.",POSITIVE,0.9912,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
"A campaign that  is one simply of party management, a campaign by committees and  public speakers, may fail; but a campaign to which the men and  women of the country give their unselfish and earnest efforts can  never fail.",POSITIVE,0.9923,Harrison

"And  may I note also the fact that, notwithstanding this complaint of  excessive revenue, there are some who suggest that they are not  able adequately to arouse the popular indignation against excessive  taxation because they cannot disclose to the people when or how  they are paying the taxes?",NEGATIVE,0.9887,Harrison

I am glad to know  that the people are moved to a thoughtful consideration of those  questions which are this year presented for their determination.,POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
Under a popular government like ours it is of the first importance  that every man who votes should have some reason for his vote;  that every man who attaches himself to this or that political party  should intelligently understand both the creed and the purposes of  the party to which he belongs.,POSITIVE,0.9987,Harrison
"I think it is universally conceded  by Democrats as well as by Republicans that the questions involved  in this campaign do have a very direct bearing upon the national  prosperity, and upon the prosperity and welfare of the individual  citizen.",NEGATIVE,0.8958,Harrison

This  much is conceded.,NEGATIVE,0.5821,Harrison
I do not intend to-day to argue the question in  any detail.,NEGATIVE,0.9804,Harrison
"I want to call your attention to a few general facts  and principles, and the first one—the one I never tire of mentioning;  the one I deem so important that I do not shun the charge  that I am repeating myself—is this: that the condition of the wage-workers  of America is better than that of the wage-workers of any  other country in the world.",POSITIVE,0.9988,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
"Now, if that be true, it  is important that you should each find out why it is so; that each  one of you should determine for himself what effect a protective  tariff has had and is likely to have upon his wages and his pros[100]perity.",POSITIVE,0.8242,Harrison
"Does it need to be demonstrated that if we reduce our tariff  to a revenue level, if we abolish from it every consideration of protection,  more goods will come in from abroad than come in now?",NEGATIVE,0.9139,Harrison
And what is the necessary effect?,POSITIVE,0.5882,Harrison
It is the transfer to foreign shops  of work that you need here; it is to diminish American production  and increase English production.,NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison
That is to be the effect of it.,NEGATIVE,0.6226,Harrison
"It is, not worth while to stand  upon nice definitions as to free trade.",NEGATIVE,0.9996,Harrison
Some think it enough to  say that they are not free-traders because they are not in favor of  abolishing all customs duties.,NEGATIVE,0.6656,Harrison
"Let me remind such that the free-trade  countries of Europe, recognized to be such, have not abolished  all customs duties.",POSITIVE,0.9955,Harrison
"A better distinction is this: The free-trader  believes in levying customs duties without any regard to the effect  of those duties upon the wages of our working people, or upon the  production of our own shops.",NEGATIVE,0.8106,Harrison
"This, then, is the issue.",NEGATIVE,0.9475,Harrison
Take it  to your homes.,POSITIVE,0.9277,Harrison
There are many confusing and contradictory statements  made in the public press and by public speakers.,NEGATIVE,0.999,Harrison
Ask any  of those who assail our protective system whether they do not  believe that if their policy is adopted a larger amount of foreign-made  goods will come into this country.,NEGATIVE,0.9854,Harrison
It is their purpose to  increase importation in order to cheapen prices.,NEGATIVE,0.819,Harrison
"I think I may  safely ask you to consider the question whether this cheapening  of prices, which they seem to regard as the highest attainment of  statesmanship, is consistent with the rate of wages that our working  people enjoy now, whether it will not involve—if we are to  have foreign competition without favoring duties—a reduction of  American wages to the standard of the wages paid abroad.",POSITIVE,0.9019,Harrison

Do you believe for one moment that two factories  making the same product can be maintained in competition when  one pays thirty-three per cent.,NEGATIVE,0.998,Harrison

"If you shall do that I do not doubt that  the working people of this country will this November forever  settle the question that American customs duties shall by intention,  by forethought, have regard to the wages of our working people.",POSITIVE,0.964,Harrison

"I can only ask you to think of them,  and not to mistake the issue.",POSITIVE,0.9987,Harrison
It is very plain.,NEGATIVE,1.0,Harrison
It is the question of  whether our tariff laws shall be a protection to American workingmen  and a protection to American manufacturing establishments.,NEGATIVE,0.9546,Harrison
"Those who advocate tariff for revenue only do not take any thought  of our wage-workers, but let their interests take care of themselves.",POSITIVE,0.992,Harrison
On the other hand the Republican party believes that high regard  should be paid to the question what the effect will be upon wages  and upon the protection of our American shops.,NEGATIVE,0.6319,Harrison
"Those who believe  the doctrine agree with us; and those who assail it, and say it is  unconstitutional, as has recently been said by a distinguished citizen,  would destroy our protective system if they could.",NEGATIVE,0.9952,Harrison
"We must  believe so, because we must impute to them sincerity in what they  say.",POSITIVE,0.9513,Harrison
"I believe this campaign will settle for many years to come  the question of whether legislation shall be intelligently directed  in favor of the doctrine that we will, so far as may be, see that our  farmers may find home consumers for their home product, and that  these populous manufacturing centres may give a larger value to  the farms that lie about them.",NEGATIVE,0.7151,Harrison

"Those who teach that the import duty upon foreign goods sold  in our market is paid by the consumer, and that the price of the  domestic competing article is enhanced to the amount of the duty  on the imported article—that every million of dollars collected for  customs duties represents many millions more which do not reach  the treasury, but are paid by our citizens as the increased cost of  domestic productions resulting from the tariff laws—may not intend  to discredit in the minds of others our system of levying duties on  competing foreign products, but it is clearly already discredited in  their own.",NEGATIVE,0.9894,Harrison

"They may be safely  allowed to call their project ""Tariff Reform,"" if the people understand  that in the end the argument compels free trade in all competing  products.",NEGATIVE,0.6005,Harrison
"This end may not be reached abruptly, and its[110]approach may be accompanied with some expressions of sympathy  for our protected industries and our working people, but it will  certainly come if these early steps do not arouse the people to effective  resistance.",NEGATIVE,0.87,Harrison
"The Republican party holds that a protective tariff is constitutional,  wholesome, and necessary.",POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
"We do not offer a fixed schedule,  but a principle.",POSITIVE,0.9978,Harrison
"We will revise the schedule, modify rates, but  always with an intelligent provision as to the effect upon domestic  productions and the wages of our working people.",POSITIVE,0.9828,Harrison
"We believe it  to be one of the worthy objects of tariff legislation to preserve  the American market for American producers, and to maintain the  American scale of wages by adequate discriminative duties upon  foreign competing products.",POSITIVE,0.9967,Harrison
"The effect of lower rates and larger  importations upon the public revenue is contingent and doubtful,  but not so the effect upon American production and American  wages.",POSITIVE,0.7591,Harrison
Less work and lower wages must be accepted as the inevitable  result of the increased offering of foreign goods in our market.,NEGATIVE,0.9958,Harrison
"By way of recompense for this reduction in his wages, and  the loss of the American market, it is suggested that the diminished  wages of the workingman will have an undiminished purchasing  power, and that he will be able to make up for the loss of the home  market by an enlarged foreign market.",NEGATIVE,0.636,Harrison
Our workingmen have  the settlement of the question in their own hands.,POSITIVE,0.9988,Harrison
They now  obtain higher wages and live more comfortably than those of any  other country.,POSITIVE,0.9975,Harrison
They will make choice of the substantial advantages  they have in hand and the deceptive promises and forecasts  of these theorizing reformers.,POSITIVE,0.7871,Harrison
They will decide for themselves and  for their country whether the protective system shall be continued  or destroyed.,POSITIVE,0.9954,Harrison
"The fact of a treasury surplus, the amount of which is variously  stated, has directed public attention to a consideration of the  methods by which the national income may best be reduced to the  level of a wise and necessary expenditure.",POSITIVE,0.5702,Harrison
This condition has  been seized upon by those who are hostile to protective customs  duties as an advantageous base of attack upon our tariff laws.,NEGATIVE,0.9473,Harrison
"They have magnified and nursed the surplus, which they affect to  deprecate, seemingly for the purpose of exaggerating the evil, in  order to reconcile the people to the extreme remedy they propose.",NEGATIVE,0.8331,Harrison
"A proper reduction of the revenues does not necessitate, and should  not suggest, the abandonment or impairment of the protective system.",NEGATIVE,0.9756,Harrison
The methods suggested by our convention will not need to  be exhausted in order to effect the necessary reduction.,POSITIVE,0.9806,Harrison
"We are  not likely to be called upon, I think, to make a present choice[111]between the surrender of the protective system and the entire repeal  of the internal taxes.",NEGATIVE,0.9682,Harrison
"Such a contingency, in view of the present  relation of expenditures to revenues, is remote.",NEGATIVE,0.814,Harrison
"The inspection  and regulation of the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine is  important, and the revenue derived from it is not so great that the  repeal of the law need enter into any plan of revenue reduction.",NEGATIVE,0.9909,Harrison
The surplus now in the treasury should be used in the purchase of  bonds.,NEGATIVE,0.9752,Harrison
"The law authorizes this use of it, and if it is not needed  for current or deficiency appropriations, the people, and not the  banks in which it has been deposited, should have the advantage  of its use by stopping interest upon the public debt.",NEGATIVE,0.7008,Harrison
"At least those  who needlessly hoard it should not be allowed to use the fear of  a monetary stringency, thus produced, to coerce public sentiment  upon other questions.",NEGATIVE,0.9072,Harrison
Closely connected with the subject of the tariff is that of the  importation of foreign laborers under contracts of service to be performed  here.,POSITIVE,0.9882,Harrison
"The law now in force prohibiting such contracts  received my cordial support in the Senate, and such amendments  as may be found necessary effectively to deliver our working men  and women from this most inequitable form of competition will  have my sincere advocacy.",POSITIVE,0.9665,Harrison
"Legislation prohibiting the importation  of laborers under contract to serve here will, however, afford  very inadequate relief to our working people if the system of protective  duties is broken down.",NEGATIVE,0.9953,Harrison
"If the products of American shops  must compete in the American market, without favoring duties,  with the products of cheap foreign labor the effect will be different,  if at all, only in degree, whether the cheap laborer is across  the street or over the sea.",NEGATIVE,0.9738,Harrison
"Such competition will soon reduce wages  here to the level of those abroad, and when that condition is  reached we will not need any laws forbidding the importation of  laborers under contract—they will have no inducement to come,  and the employer no inducement to send for them.",NEGATIVE,0.9962,Harrison
In the earlier years of our history public agencies to promote  immigration were common.,NEGATIVE,0.5432,Harrison
The pioneer wanted a neighbor with  more friendly instincts than the Indian.,NEGATIVE,0.9901,Harrison
Labor was scarce and  fully employed.,POSITIVE,0.8124,Harrison
But the day of the immigration bureau has gone  by.,NEGATIVE,0.9818,Harrison
"While our doors will continue open to proper immigration,  we do not need to issue special invitations to the inhabitants of  other countries to come to our shores or to share our citizenship.",NEGATIVE,0.6698,Harrison
"Indeed, the necessity of some inspection and limitation is obvious.",NEGATIVE,0.9867,Harrison
We should resolutely refuse to permit foreign governments  to send their paupers and criminals to our ports.,NEGATIVE,0.9768,Harrison
We are also  clearly under a duty to defend our civilization by excluding alien[112]races whose ultimate assimilation with our people is neither possible  nor desirable.,NEGATIVE,0.8979,Harrison
"The family has been the nucleus of our best  immigration, and the home the most potent assimilating force in  our civilization.",POSITIVE,0.999,Harrison
"The objections to Chinese immigration are distinctive and conclusive,  and are now so generally accepted as such that the question  has passed entirely beyond the stage of argument.",POSITIVE,0.8847,Harrison
"The laws relating  to this subject would, if I should be charged with their enforcement,  be faithfully executed.",POSITIVE,0.9284,Harrison
Such amendments or further legislation  as may be necessary and proper to prevent evasions of the laws  and to stop further Chinese immigration would also meet my approval.,POSITIVE,0.9227,Harrison
The expression of the convention upon this subject is in  entire harmony with my views.,POSITIVE,0.999,Harrison
"Our civil compact is a government by majorities, and the law loses  its sanction and the magistrate our respect when this compact is  broken.",NEGATIVE,0.9933,Harrison
The evil results of election frauds do not expend themselves  upon the voters who are robbed of their rightful influence in  public affairs.,NEGATIVE,0.9666,Harrison
"The individual or community or party that practises  or connives at election frauds has suffered irreparable injury,  and will sooner or later realize that to exchange the American  system of majority rule for minority control is not only unlawful  and unpatriotic, but very unsafe for those who promote it.",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison
The  disfranchisement of a single legal elector by fraud or intimidation  is a crime too grave to be regarded lightly.,NEGATIVE,0.9984,Harrison
The right of every  qualified elector to cast one free ballot and to have it honestly  counted must not be questioned.,POSITIVE,0.9988,Harrison
Every constitutional power should  be used to make this right secure and to punish frauds upon the  ballot.,POSITIVE,0.9953,Harrison
"Our colored people do not ask special legislation in their interest,  but only to be made secure in the common rights of American citizenship.",POSITIVE,0.9972,Harrison
"They will, however, naturally mistrust the sincerity of  those party leaders who appeal to their race for support only in  those localities where the suffrage is free and election results  doubtful, and compass their disfranchisement where their votes  would be controlling and their choice cannot be coerced.",NEGATIVE,0.9983,Harrison
"The Nation, not less than the States, is dependent for prosperity  and security upon the intelligence and morality of the people.",POSITIVE,0.9943,Harrison
This common interest very early suggested national aid in the  establishment and endowment of schools and colleges in the new  States.,POSITIVE,0.9778,Harrison
"There is, I believe, a present exigency that calls for still  more liberal and direct appropriations in aid of common-school  education in the States.",NEGATIVE,0.8255,Harrison
"The territorial form of government is a temporary expedient,[113]not a permanent civil condition.",NEGATIVE,0.9929,Harrison
"It is adapted to the exigency  that suggested it, but becomes inadequate, and even oppressive,  when applied to fixed and populous communities.",NEGATIVE,0.9989,Harrison
Several Territories  are well able to bear the burdens and discharge the duties of  free commonwealths in the American Union.,POSITIVE,0.9977,Harrison
"To exclude them  is to deny the just rights of their people, and may well excite their  indignant protest.",NEGATIVE,0.9853,Harrison
No question of the political preference of the  people of a Territory should close against them the hospitable door  which has opened to two-thirds of the existing States.,POSITIVE,0.9926,Harrison
But admissions  should be resolutely refused to any Territory a majority  of whose people cherish institutions that are repugnant to our  civilization or inconsistent with a republican form of government.,NEGATIVE,0.9716,Harrison
"The declaration of the convention against ""all combinations of  capital, organized in trusts or otherwise, to control arbitrarily the  condition of trade among our citizens,"" is in harmony with the  views entertained and publicly expressed by me long before the  assembling of the convention.",POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
"Ordinarily, capital shares the losses  of idleness with labor; but under the operation of the trust, in  some of its forms, the wageworker alone suffers loss, while idle  capital receives its dividends from a trust fund.",NEGATIVE,0.7527,Harrison
"Producers who  refuse to join the combination are destroyed, and competition as  an element of prices is eliminated.",NEGATIVE,0.9884,Harrison
It cannot be doubted that the  legislative authority should and will find a method of dealing fairly  and effectively with those and other abuses connected with this  subject.,POSITIVE,0.9975,Harrison
It can hardly be necessary for me to say that I am heartily in  sympathy with the declaration of the convention upon the subject  of pensions to our soldiers and sailors.,POSITIVE,0.9738,Harrison
"What they gave and what  they suffered I had some opportunity to observe, and, in a small  measure, to experience.",NEGATIVE,0.977,Harrison
"They gave ungrudgingly; it was not a  trade, but an offering.",NEGATIVE,0.9264,Harrison
"The measure was heaped up, running over.",NEGATIVE,1.0,Harrison
What they achieved only a distant generation can adequately tell.,POSITIVE,0.997,Harrison
"Without attempting to discuss particular propositions, I may add  that measures in behalf of the surviving veterans of the war and of  the families of their dead comrades should be conceived and executed  in a spirit of justice and of the most grateful liberality, and  that, in the competition for civil appointments, honorable military  service should have appropriate recognition.",POSITIVE,0.9949,Harrison
The law regulating appointments to the classified civil service  received my support in the Senate in the belief that it opened the  way to a much-needed reform.,POSITIVE,0.9023,Harrison
"I still think so, and, therefore,  cordially approve the clear and forcible expression of the convention  upon this subject.",POSITIVE,0.9971,Harrison
The law should have the aid of a friendly[114]interpretation and be faithfully and vigorously enforced.,POSITIVE,0.9687,Harrison
All appointments  under it should be absolutely free from partisan considerations  and influence.,POSITIVE,0.9719,Harrison
"Some extensions of the classified list  are practicable and desirable, and further legislation extending the  reform to other branches of the service to which it is applicable  would receive my approval.",NEGATIVE,0.8961,Harrison
"In appointment to every grade and  department, fitness, and not party service, should be the essential  and discriminating test, and fidelity and efficiency the only sure  tenure of office.",POSITIVE,0.9965,Harrison
Only the interests of the public service should suggest  removals from office.,NEGATIVE,0.839,Harrison
I know the practical difficulties attending  the attempt to apply the spirit of the civil service rules to all  appointments and removals.,NEGATIVE,0.9907,Harrison
"It will, however, be my sincere purpose,  if elected, to advance the reform.",NEGATIVE,0.5481,Harrison
I notice with pleasure that the convention did not omit to  express its solicitude for the promotion of virtue and temperance  among our people.,POSITIVE,0.9199,Harrison
"The Republican party has always been friendly  to everything that tended to make the home life of our people free,  pure, and prosperous, and will in the future be true to its history  in this respect.",POSITIVE,0.9885,Harrison
Our relations with foreign powers should be characterized by  friendliness and respect.,POSITIVE,0.9986,Harrison
The right of our people and of our ships  to hospitable treatment should be insisted upon with dignity and  firmness.,POSITIVE,0.9983,Harrison
"Our Nation is too great, both in material strength and  in moral power, to indulge in bluster or to be suspected of timorousness.",POSITIVE,0.9528,Harrison
Vacillation and inconsistency are as incompatible with  successful diplomacy as they are with the national dignity.,NEGATIVE,0.9519,Harrison
We  should especially cultivate and extend our diplomatic and commercial  relations with the Central and South American States.,POSITIVE,0.9959,Harrison
Our  fisheries should be fostered and protected.,POSITIVE,0.9886,Harrison
The hardships and  risks that are the necessary incidents of the business should not  be increased by an inhospitable exclusion from the near-lying ports.,NEGATIVE,0.8274,Harrison
"The resources of a firm, dignified, and consistent diplomacy are undoubtedly  equal to the prompt and peaceful solution of the difficulties  that now exist.",POSITIVE,0.9998,Harrison
Our neighbors will surely not expect in our  ports a commercial hospitality they deny to us in theirs.,NEGATIVE,0.6261,Harrison
I cannot extend this letter by a special reference to other subjects  upon which the convention gave an expression.,NEGATIVE,0.9641,Harrison
"In respect to them, as well as to those I have noticed, I am in  entire agreement with the declarations of the convention.",POSITIVE,0.9983,Harrison
"The  resolutions relating to the coinage, to the rebuilding of the navy,  to coast defences, and to public lands, express conclusions to all of  which I gave my support in the Senate.",POSITIVE,0.9759,Harrison
"Inviting a calm and thoughtful consideration of these public[115]questions, we submit them to the people.",POSITIVE,0.9981,Harrison
Their intelligent patriotism  and the good Providence that made and has kept us a Nation  will lead them to wise and safe conclusions.,POSITIVE,0.9977,Harrison
"Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Reunion of the Seventieth Indiana Regiment.",POSITIVE,0.992,Harrison

"We thank you and the good citizens of Clayton, for whom  you have spoken, that you have opened your hearts so fully to us  to-day.",POSITIVE,0.9923,Harrison
I am sure we have never assembled under circumstances  more attractive than those that now surround us.,POSITIVE,0.8726,Harrison
"The mellow sunshine  of this autumn-time that falls upon us, the balmy air which  moves the leaves of those shadowing trees, the sweet calm and spell  of nature that is over everything, makes the day one of those that  may be described in the language of the old poet as Your hospitable welcome makes us feel at home, and in behalf  of this large representation of our regiment, possibly the largest  that has assembled since the close of the war, gathered not only  from these adjacent counties, but from distant homes beyond the  Mississippi and the Missouri, I give you to-day in return our  most hearty thanks for your great kindness.",POSITIVE,0.9996,Harrison
"The autumn-time is a fit time for our gathering, for our spring-time  is gone.",POSITIVE,0.5112,Harrison

"The exhaustion of march and camp and battle, and  the civil strife of the years that have passed since the close of the  war, have left their marks upon us, and, as we gather from year  to year, we notice the signs of advancing age, and the roster of  our dead is lengthened.",POSITIVE,0.9775,Harrison

"If it is worth while to build  monuments to heroism and patriotic sacrifice that may stand as  dumb yet eloquent instructors of the generation that is to come, so  it is worth while that these survivors of the war assemble in their  national encampments and march once more, unarmed, through  the streets of our cities, whose peace and prosperity they have  secured.",POSITIVE,0.9851,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison

We have a  body of citizen soldiers instructed in tactics and strategy and ac[121]customed  to the points of war that make this Nation very strong  and formidable.,POSITIVE,0.9864,Harrison

They  are very numerous now.,POSITIVE,0.9288,Harrison

The war  was also an educator in political economy.,POSITIVE,0.9349,Harrison

No loyal and orderly citizen will mistrust their friendliness.,NEGATIVE,0.8232,Harrison
The people of Indiana will not ask that you procure any permit or  give bond to keep the peace before passing through this loyal State  with arms in your hands.,POSITIVE,0.9912,Harrison
"I am especially complimented by the visit of this organized company  of the Missouri militia, composed wholly of Union veterans.",POSITIVE,0.9986,Harrison
It gives evidence that those who served in the Civil War are still  watchful of the honor and safety of our country and its flag; that  our Government may rest with security upon the defence which  our citizen-soldiers offer.,POSITIVE,0.9951,Harrison
"And now, without alluding at all to any topic of partisan interest,  I bid you welcome, and will be pleased to have a personal  introduction to each of you, if that is your pleasure.",POSITIVE,0.9866,Harrison

"General Harrison responded as follows: My Fellow-citizens—There is something very distinctive, very  interesting, and very instructive in this large delegation of workingmen  from the city of New Albany.",POSITIVE,0.9987,Harrison
Your fellow-workman  and spokesman has so eloquently presented that particular issue  upon which you have the greatest interest that I can add nothing  to the force or conclusiveness of his argument.,NEGATIVE,0.9458,Harrison
He has said that  the interests of the workingmen were especially involved in the  pending political contest.,NEGATIVE,0.5604,Harrison
I think that is conceded even by our  political opponents.,POSITIVE,0.8045,Harrison
I do not think there is a man so dull or so[123]unfair as to deny that the reduction of our tariff rates so as to  destroy the principle of protection now embodied in our laws will  have an influence on your wages and on the production of your  mills and factories.,NEGATIVE,0.9995,Harrison
"If this be true, then your interest in the question  is apparent.",POSITIVE,0.8368,Harrison
"You will want to know whether the influence  of the proposed reduction of rates is to be beneficial or hurtful;  whether the effect will be to stimulate or diminish production;  whether it will be to maintain or increase the rate of wages you  are now receiving, or to reduce them.",NEGATIVE,0.9813,Harrison
"As you shall settle these  questions, so will you vote in November.",POSITIVE,0.9562,Harrison

No man can doubt that a reduction of duties will stimulate the  importation of foreign merchandise.,POSITIVE,0.553,Harrison
None of these plate-glass  workers can doubt that a reduction of the duty upon plate-glass  will increase the importation of French plate-glass.,POSITIVE,0.9578,Harrison
None of these workers in your woollen mills can doubt that the  reduction of the duty upon the product of their mills will increase  the importation of foreign woollen goods.,POSITIVE,0.8832,Harrison
"And, if that is true, is it not also clear that this increased importation  of foreign-made goods means some idle workingmen in  your mills?",NEGATIVE,0.9228,Harrison
The party that favors such discriminating duties as  will develop American production and secure the largest amount  of work for our American shops is the party whose policy will promote  your interests.,NEGATIVE,0.9013,Harrison
"[Applause and cries of ""Hit him again!""]",POSITIVE,0.7825,Harrison
"I have heard it said by some leaders of Democratic thought that  the reduction proposed by the Mills bill, and the further reduction  which some of them are candid enough to admit they contemplate,  will stimulate American production by opening foreign markets  and that the interests of our Indiana manufacturing establishments  would thus be promoted.",POSITIVE,0.9295,Harrison
"But those who advance this argument  also say that it will not do to progress too rapidly in the direction  of free trade—that we must go slowly, because our protected industries  cannot stand too rapid an advance; it would not be safe.",NEGATIVE,0.9812,Harrison
[Laughter.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"Now, my countrymen, if this plan of revenue reform  is to be promotive of our manufacturing interests, why go slowly?",NEGATIVE,0.703,Harrison
Why not open the gates wide and let us have the promised good  all at once?,NEGATIVE,0.6311,Harrison
[Laughter and applause.],POSITIVE,0.9993,Harrison
Is it that these philosophers think the cup of prosperity will be  so sweet and full that our laboring people cannot be allowed to  drink it at one draught?,NEGATIVE,0.805,Harrison
"[Applause and cries of ""Good! good!""]",POSITIVE,0.9956,Harrison
"No, my countrymen, this statement implies what these gentlemen  know to be true—that the effect of the proposed legislation is  diminished production and diminished wages, and they desire that  you shall have an opportunity to get used to it.",NEGATIVE,0.995,Harrison

[Great applause.],POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
"If you could forget Ireland, if you could be unmoved  by her minstrelsy, untouched by the appeals of her splendid  oratory, unsympathetic with her heroes and martyrs, I should fear  that the bonds of your new citizenship would have no power over  hearts so cold and consciences so dead.",NEGATIVE,0.9654,Harrison
[Cheers.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
What if a sprig of green were found upon the bloody jacket of a  Union soldier who lay dead on Missionary Ridge?,NEGATIVE,1.0,Harrison

"That is a very  unhappy condition, indeed.",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison

I have  sometimes thought that this surplus was held chiefly to be talked  about.,NEGATIVE,0.6898,Harrison
The laws provide a use for it that would speedily place it  in circulation.,POSITIVE,0.8975,Harrison
"If a business man finds an accumulated surplus  that he does not need in his business, that stands as a bank balance  and draws no interest, and if he has notes outside to mature in the  future he will make a ready choice between leaving his balance in  the bank and using it to take up his obligations.",NEGATIVE,0.9984,Harrison

"It is this subdivision of labor, these[128]diversified industries, that make Illinois take rank so near the head  among the States.",POSITIVE,0.9797,Harrison

It seems to me  that the wild exhilaration which in the earlier reunions we often  saw is very much sobered as we come together now.,POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison

The story of the rebel prison  pens was one of grim horror.,NEGATIVE,0.9781,Harrison
"In the field our armies, always  brave, were generally always chivalric and humane.",POSITIVE,0.9981,Harrison

They will be called on in November to mark out the revenue  policy for our Government by choosing public officers pledged to the  principles which a majority of our people approve.,POSITIVE,0.5988,Harrison
Fortunately you  have now an issue very clearly drawn and very easy to be understood.,POSITIVE,0.9931,Harrison
In previous campaigns we have not quite known where our  adversaries stood.,NEGATIVE,0.5549,Harrison
Now we do know.,POSITIVE,0.9579,Harrison
Our Democratic friends  say a protective tariff is robbery.,NEGATIVE,0.9578,Harrison
You see this written at the  head of campaign tracts circulated by their committees.,NEGATIVE,0.9669,Harrison
You  hear it said in the public speeches of their leaders.,POSITIVE,0.992,Harrison
"You have  not once, I think, in the campaign heard any Democratic speaker  admit that even a low protective tariff was desirable.",NEGATIVE,0.963,Harrison
"Those  who, like Mr. Randall, have in former campaigns been used to  allay the apprehension of our working people by talking protection  have been silenced.",NEGATIVE,0.9611,Harrison
"On the other hand, the Republican  party declares by its platform and by its speakers that a protective  tariff is wise and necessary.",POSITIVE,0.8148,Harrison
There is the issue.,NEGATIVE,0.9689,Harrison
Make  your own choice.,NEGATIVE,0.9105,Harrison
"If you approve by your votes the doctrine that  a protective tariff is public robbery, you will expect your representatives  to stop this public robbery, and if they are faithful  they will do it; not seven per cent. of it, but all of it.",NEGATIVE,0.985,Harrison
"[Applause  and cries of ""That's it!""]",POSITIVE,0.9618,Harrison
So that I beg you all to recollect that  you will vote this fall for or against the principle of protection.,POSITIVE,0.7177,Harrison
You are invited to a feast of cheapness.,NEGATIVE,0.9932,Harrison
"You are promised foreign-made  goods at very low prices, and domestic competing goods, if  any are made, at the same low rates.",NEGATIVE,0.9946,Harrison
But do not forget that the[133]spectre of low wages will also attend the feast.,NEGATIVE,0.8958,Harrison
"[Applause and  cries of ""That's so!""]",POSITIVE,0.6688,Harrison
"Inevitably, as certain as the night follows  the day, the adoption of this policy means lower wages.",NEGATIVE,0.9918,Harrison
"Choose,  then, and do not forget that this cheapening process may be pushed  so far as to involve the cheapening of human life and the loss of  human happiness.",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison

And now a word about the surplus in the Treasury.,POSITIVE,0.6422,Harrison
"Our Democratic  friends did not know what else to do with it, and so they  have deposited it in certain national banks.",NEGATIVE,0.9909,Harrison
"The Government gets  no interest upon it, but it is loaned out by the banks to our citizens  at interest.",NEGATIVE,0.9769,Harrison
Our income is more than our current expenses.,POSITIVE,0.9939,Harrison
"There is no authority for the Secretary of the Treasury to lend the  money, and so only three methods of dealing with it presented  themselves, under the law—first, to lock it up in the Treasury  vaults; second, to deposit it in the banks without interest; or, third,  to use it in the purchase of bonds not yet due.",NEGATIVE,0.998,Harrison
The objection to  the first method was that the withdrawal of so large a sum might  result in a monetary stringency; the second obviated this objection  by allowing the banks to put the money in circulation; but  neither method resulted in any advantage to the Government.,NEGATIVE,0.9951,Harrison
As to it the money was dead; only the banks received interest  for its use.,NEGATIVE,1.0,Harrison
By the third method the money would be returned to  the channels of trade and the Government would make the difference  between the premium paid for the bond and the interest that  the bonds would draw if left outstanding until they matured.,NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
"If  a Government bond at the market premium is a good investment  for a capitalist who is free to use his money as he pleases, can it  be bad finance for the Government, having money that it cannot  use in any other way, to use it in buying up its bonds?",NEGATIVE,0.9984,Harrison
[Great  applause.],POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
It is not whether we will purposely raise money to  buy our bonds at a premium—no one would advise that—but will  we so use a surplus that we have on hand and cannot lawfully pay  out in any other way?,NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
"Do our Democratic friends propose to give  the banks the free use of it until our bonds mature, or do they propose  to reduce our annual income below our expenditure by a revision  of the tariff until this surplus is used, and then revise the tariff  again to restore the equilibriums?",NEGATIVE,0.998,Harrison
[Great applause.],POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
I welcome  the presence to-day of these ladies of your households.,POSITIVE,0.987,Harrison
We should  not forget that we have working-women in America.,POSITIVE,0.9936,Harrison

"I thank you for the kind feelings  that prompted you to come, and for the generous things General  Hayes has said in your behalf.",POSITIVE,0.9951,Harrison
There is little that I can say and  little that I can appropriately do to promote the success of the Republican  principles.,NEGATIVE,0.9632,Harrison
A campaign that enlists the earnest and active  co-operation of the individual voters will have a safe issue.,POSITIVE,0.82,Harrison
I am  glad to see in your presence an evidence that in your locality this  individual interest is felt.,POSITIVE,0.9992,Harrison

I remember that the Second Indiana Cavalry was the first full  cavalry regiment I ever saw.,POSITIVE,0.9792,Harrison
"I saw it marching through Washington  Street from the windows of my law office; and as I watched  the long line drawing itself through the street, it seemed to me  the call for troops might stop; that there were certainly enough  men and horses there to put down the rebellion.",NEGATIVE,0.8135,Harrison

"There is probably not a shop represented here that has not among  its workingmen those who have tried the conditions of life in the  old country, and are able to speak from personal experience.",NEGATIVE,0.9549,Harrison

I welcome you[137]as representatives of one of the great industries of our country.,POSITIVE,0.9959,Harrison
The demands of the farm have been met by the ingenuity of your  shops.,POSITIVE,0.9954,Harrison
The improvement in farm machinery within my own recollection  has been marvellous.,POSITIVE,0.9976,Harrison
The scythe and the cradle still held  control in the harvest field when I first went out to carry the noon  meal to the workmen.,POSITIVE,0.9981,Harrison
Afterward it sometimes fell to my lot  in the hay-field to drive one of the old-fashioned combination reapers  and mowers.,POSITIVE,0.8498,Harrison

When the drivers struck a stump  the horse had no power over the machine in either direction.,NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison

"Within the last year I have been reading, wholly[141]without any view to politics, the story of our diplomatic relations  with England during the Civil War.",NEGATIVE,0.6696,Harrison
"The motive that most strongly  influenced the English mind in its sympathy with the South was the  expectancy of free trade with the Confederacy [cries of ""That's  right!""], and among the most influential publications intended to  urge English recognition and aid to the Confederates was a book  entitled ""The American Union,"" by James Spence.",POSITIVE,0.5446,Harrison
"It was published  in 1862, and ran through several editions.",NEGATIVE,0.9977,Harrison
"Speaking of the  South he said: ""No part of the world can be found more admirably placed for  exchanging with this country the products of industry to mutual  advantage than the Southern States of the Union.",POSITIVE,0.9454,Harrison

"[Cries of ""You are right!""]",POSITIVE,0.7743,Harrison

My Wabash County Friends and my Little Friends from Parke—I  am very glad to meet you here to-day.,POSITIVE,0.9897,Harrison
My friend who has spoken  for Wabash County has very truly said that the relations between  me and the Republicans of that county have always been exceedingly  cordial.,POSITIVE,0.9967,Harrison
"I remember well when I first visited your county  in 1860, almost a boy in years, altogether a boy in political experience.",POSITIVE,0.9197,Harrison
I was then a candidate for Reporter of the Decisions of the  Supreme Court of this State.,POSITIVE,0.7611,Harrison
"You had in one of your own citizens,  afterward a distinguished soldier, a candidate for that office  in the convention that nominated me, but that did not interfere  at all with the cordial welcome from your people when, as the  nominee of the party, I came into your county.",POSITIVE,0.9643,Harrison
I think from  that day to this my name has never been mentioned in any convention  for any office that I have not had almost the unanimous support  of the Republicans of Wabash County.,NEGATIVE,0.7165,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
This is  no new interest which you now manifest to-day.,NEGATIVE,0.9988,Harrison
The expressions  of your confidence have been very numerous and have been continued  through nearly thirty years.,POSITIVE,0.9992,Harrison
There is one word on one subject that I want to say.,POSITIVE,0.9471,Harrison
Our Democratic  friends tell us that there are about a hundred millions—their  arithmeticians do not agree on the exact figures—in the public  Treasury for which the Government has no need.,NEGATIVE,0.9987,Harrison
"They have found[144]only this method of using it, viz.: depositing it in the national  banks of the country, to be loaned out by them to our citizens at  interest, the Government getting no interest whatever from the  banks.",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison
"I suggested, and it was not an original suggestion with  me—Senator Sherman has advocated the same policy with great  ability in the Senate—that this money had better be used in buying  Government bonds, because the Government would make some  money in applying it that way, and there was no other way in  which they could get any interest on it at all.",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison
But it is said if  we use it in this manner we pay a premium to the bondholders.,POSITIVE,0.9544,Harrison
But it is only the same premium that the bonds are bringing in the  market.,NEGATIVE,0.9305,Harrison
"In other words, as I said the other day, capitalists who  can use their money as they please—put it out on mortgages, at interest,  or in any other way—think the Government bond at the current  rate of premium is a good investment for them.",NEGATIVE,0.8932,Harrison
"Now, the  Government can buy those bonds at that premium and save a great  deal of interest.",POSITIVE,0.9821,Harrison
I will not undertake to give you figures.,NEGATIVE,0.9997,Harrison
"One  issue of these bonds matures in 1907, and bears four per cent.",NEGATIVE,0.5077,Harrison
annual  interest.,POSITIVE,0.9987,Harrison
"Now, suppose this surplus money were to remain all  that time in the banks without bringing any interest to the Government;  is there a man here so dull that he cannot see the great loss  that would result to the people?",NEGATIVE,1.0,Harrison
I have another objection to this  policy: the favoritism that is involved in it.,NEGATIVE,0.9387,Harrison
We have heard—and  from such high authority that I think that we must accept it as  true—that the great patronage appertaining to the office of President  of the United States involves a public peril.,POSITIVE,0.5886,Harrison
"Now, suppose we  add to that danger a hundred millions of dollars that the Secretary  of the Treasury can put in this community or that, in this bank or  that, at his pleasure; is not the power of the executive perilously  increased?",NEGATIVE,0.9926,Harrison
"Is it right that the use of this vast sum should be a  matter of mere favoritism, that the Secretary should be allowed to  put $10,000,000 of this surplus in Indianapolis and none of it in  Kansas City, or $75,000,000 in New York and none in Indianapolis?",NEGATIVE,0.9945,Harrison
If the money is used in buying bonds it finds its natural place—goes  where it belongs.,POSITIVE,0.9972,Harrison
This is a most serious objection to the present  method of dealing with the surplus.,NEGATIVE,0.9778,Harrison
"But if you still object to  paying the market premium when we buy these bonds, see how it  works the other way.",POSITIVE,0.65,Harrison
"The banks deposit their bonds in the Treasury  to secure these deposits, get the Government money without  interest, and still draw interest on their bonds.",NEGATIVE,0.9964,Harrison
"If any of you had  a note for a thousand dollars due in five years, bearing interest,  and your credit was so good that the note was worth a premium,  and you had twelve hundred dollars that you could not put out at[145]interest so as to offset the interest on your note, would you not  make money by using this surplus to take up the note at a fair  premium?",NEGATIVE,0.5915,Harrison
"Would you think it wise finance to give the thousand  dollars that you had on hand to your creditor without interest and  allow him to deposit your note with you as security, you paying  interest on the note until it was due and getting no interest on  your deposit?",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison

I welcome my young friends from Parke County.,POSITIVE,0.9766,Harrison
There is nothing  fuller of interest than childhood.,POSITIVE,0.858,Harrison

Expectancy makes life very rosy to them and them  very interesting to us who have passed beyond the turn of life.,POSITIVE,0.9946,Harrison

"The citizen  who really believes that this election will either give a fresh impulse  to the career of prosperity and honor in which our Nation  has walked since the war, or will clog and retard that progress,  comes far short of his duty if he does not in his own place as a citizen  make his influence felt for the truth upon those who are near  him.",NEGATIVE,0.9972,Harrison

You come from a community that has recently  awakened to the fact that beneath the soil which has long yielded  bounteous harvests to your farmers there was stored by nature a  great and new source of wealth.,POSITIVE,0.9992,Harrison

This fact should quicken and  intensify the interest of these communities in this contest for the  preservation of the American system of protection.,POSITIVE,0.991,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
It is said by some of our opponents that a protective tariff has no[150]influence upon wages; that labor in the United States has nothing  to fear from the competition from pauper labor; that in the contest  between pauper labor and high priced labor pauper labor was  always driven out.,NEGATIVE,0.9782,Harrison

Do they  hope that when the coat is made cheaper the wages of the man or  woman who makes it will be increased?,NEGATIVE,0.9997,Harrison
The power of your labor  organizations to secure increased wages is greatest when there is a  large demand for the product you are making at fair prices.,POSITIVE,0.9571,Harrison
You  do not strike for better wages on a falling market.,NEGATIVE,0.9631,Harrison

"I am  one of the oldest Republicans; my first presidential vote was given[160]to the first Republican candidate for that office [applause], and it  has always been a source of profound gratification to me that, in  peace and war, a high spirit of patriotism and devotion to our  country has always pervaded and dominated the party.",POSITIVE,0.9984,Harrison

"He rode alone, the one horseman in that desperate charge, and  died on that bloody hillside rather than subject his State to the imputation  that one of her sons had lingered when the enemy was to  be engaged.",NEGATIVE,0.9965,Harrison

"[Cheers and  cries of ""Good! Good!""]",POSITIVE,0.9965,Harrison
I believe there are indications that the  independent manhood of the South will this year strongly manifest  itself in this direction.,POSITIVE,0.9393,Harrison
Those intelligent and progressive citizens  of the South who are seeking to build up within their own States  diversified industries will not much longer be kept in bondage to  the traditions of the days when the South was wholly a community  of planters.,POSITIVE,0.9831,Harrison
"When they assert their belief in a protective tariff, by supporting  the only party that advocates that policy, the question of a[163]free ballot, so far as it is a Southern question, will be settled forever,  for they will have the power to insist that those who believe  with them shall vote, and that their votes shall be counted.",POSITIVE,0.876,Harrison

"The protective policy, by developing a home supply and  limiting importations, helps us to maintain the balance of trade  upon our side in our dealings with the world.",POSITIVE,0.9986,Harrison

"Under  the tariff of 1846 from the year 1850 to 1860 the balance of trade  was continuously against us, aggregating in that period over three  hundred millions of dollars.",NEGATIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"Under the influence of a protective  tariff the balance of trade has been generally and largely with us,  unless disturbed by special conditions.",POSITIVE,0.8544,Harrison
Instead of sending our  gold abroad to pay a foreign balance we have usually been bringing  foreign gold here to augment our store.,POSITIVE,0.9063,Harrison

"It is extremely gratifying to be assured by your presence here this  inclement day, and by the kind words which you have addressed  to me through your representatives, that I have some part in your  friendly regard as an individual.",POSITIVE,0.994,Harrison
But individuals are not of the  first importance.,NEGATIVE,0.9646,Harrison
That man who thinks that the prosperity of this  country or the right administration of its affairs is wholly dependent  upon him grossly exaggerates his value.,NEGATIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"The essential things  to us are the principles of government upon which our institutions  were builded, and by and through which we make that symmetrical  and safe growth which has characterized our Nation in the past,  and which is yet to raise it to a higher place among the nations  of the earth.",POSITIVE,0.9999,Harrison

"Your spokesmen have referred with an honest pride to the  counties from which you have come, and that is well.",POSITIVE,0.9989,Harrison
"But I would  like to suggest to you that every political community and neighborhood  has a character of its own, a moral character, as well as every  man and every woman, and it is exceedingly important, looked at  even from the side of material advantage, that our communities  should maintain a good reputation for social order, intelligence,  virtue, and a faithful and willing obedience to law.",POSITIVE,0.9963,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
"It cannot be doubted that such a character possessed by any State  or county attracts immigration and capital, advances its material  development, and enhances the value of its farms.",POSITIVE,0.9989,Harrison
There has been  much in the history of Indiana that is exceedingly creditable.,POSITIVE,0.9949,Harrison
There have been some things—there are some things to-day—that  are exceedingly discreditable to us as a political community; things  that I believe retard the advancement of our State and affect its  material prosperity by degrading it in the estimation of right-thinking  men.,NEGATIVE,0.9772,Harrison
"One of those things is this patent and open fact: that  the great benevolent institutions of this State, instead of being operated  upon the high plane that public charities should occupy, are[165]being operated and managed upon the lowest plane of party purposes  and advantage.",NEGATIVE,0.6703,Harrison
"[Cries of ""That's so!""]",NEGATIVE,0.9496,Harrison
Another such thing  is of recent occurrence.,NEGATIVE,0.9982,Harrison

"Is there a man in the  State, Democratic or Republican, who doubts that if the choice had  been otherwise, and Mr. Nelson had received a majority at the  polls, the House of Representatives, which was Republican, would  have met with the Democratic Senate in an orderly joint meeting,  for canvassing the votes, and that Mr. Nelson would have been inaugurated  as Lieutenant-Governor?",NEGATIVE,0.9968,Harrison
"[Cries of ""No, no!""]",NEGATIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"But the  result was otherwise; and the public fame, the good reputation of  this State, was dishonored when, by force and brutal methods, the  voice of the people was stifled, and the man they had chosen was  excluded from the right to exercise the duties of the office of  Lieutenant-Governor.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
"[Cries of ""Yes, yes!""]",POSITIVE,0.9778,Harrison
Do the people think  that the attractiveness of Indiana as a home for Americans who believe  in social order and popular government has been increased  by this violent and disgraceful incident?,NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison

"I believe the material prosperity of Indiana, much more[166]the honor, will be advanced if her people in this State election  shall rebuke the shameless election frauds that have recently scandalized  our State, the prostitution of our benevolent institutions,  and the wanton violence that overturned the result of the popular  election in 1886.",NEGATIVE,0.8866,Harrison

"Among the  many honors which may be placed on me in the future there will  be none, I can assure you, that I will esteem more highly than my  membership in this order, instituted by those who sustained the[190]flag of Washington, the flag of Perry, the flag that was baptized in  the blood of the Revolution and again in the second conflict with  the mother country; that floated over the halls of the Montezumas,  and was sustained in other wars, and which you made possible to  wave over every foot of our beloved country.",POSITIVE,0.9867,Harrison
I esteem it my greatest  honor that I bore even an humble part with you and all the  comrades of the Grand Army in bringing about this most desirable  result.,POSITIVE,0.9879,Harrison
"I wish to say before parting with you, if I may never look  upon your faces collectively again, that the parting request I would  make of you would be that each of you, without regard to party  (and I believe I can say this without offence to any comrade of the  Grand Army), stand shoulder to shoulder, as we did during the  war, to preserve a free and honest ballot.",POSITIVE,0.8479,Harrison

Chief-Justice Fuller  administered the oath of office.,POSITIVE,0.9755,Harrison
President Harrison delivered his inaugural address from  the terrace of the Capitol in the presence of a vast concourse  and during a rainfall.,POSITIVE,0.9614,Harrison
There is no constitutional or legal requirement that the President  shall take the oath of office in the presence of the people.,POSITIVE,0.7681,Harrison
"But  there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public induction to  office of the chief executive officer of the Nation that from the beginning  of the Government the people, to whose service the official  oath consecrates the officer, have been called to witness the solemn  ceremonial.",POSITIVE,0.9834,Harrison
"The oath taken in the presence of the people becomes  a mutual covenant; the officer covenants to serve the whole body  of the people by a faithful execution of the laws, so that they may  be the unfailing defence and security of those who respect and observe  them, and that neither wealth and station nor the power of  combinations shall be able to evade their just penalties or to wrest  them from a beneficent public purpose to serve the ends of cruelty  or selfishness.",POSITIVE,0.9961,Harrison
"My promise is spoken; yours unspoken, but not the  less real and solemn.",POSITIVE,0.9815,Harrison
The people of every State have here their  representatives.,POSITIVE,0.994,Harrison
"Surely I do not misinterpret the spirit of the occasion  when I assume that the whole body of the people covenant  with me and with each other to-day to support and defend the Constitution  and the Union of the States, to yield willing obedience  to all the laws and each to every other citizen his equal civil and  political rights.",POSITIVE,0.9967,Harrison
"Entering thus solemnly in covenant with each  other, we may reverently invoke and confidently expect the favor  and help of Almighty God, that He will give to me wisdom,  strength, and fidelity, and to our people a spirit of fraternity and  a love of righteousness and peace.",POSITIVE,0.9976,Harrison
This occasion derives peculiar interest from the fact that the  presidential term which begins this day is the twenty-sixth under  our Constitution.,POSITIVE,0.6092,Harrison
"The first inauguration of President Washington  took place in New York, where Congress was then sitting, on April  30, 1789, having been deferred by reason of delays attending the[195]organization of the Congress and the canvass of the electoral vote.",NEGATIVE,0.7255,Harrison
"Our people have already worthily observed the centennials of the  Declaration of Independence, of the battle of Yorktown, and of the  adoption of the Constitution, and will shortly celebrate in New  York the institution of the second great department of our constitutional  scheme of government.",POSITIVE,0.9991,Harrison
"When the centennial of the institution  of the judicial department by the organization of the Supreme  Court shall have been suitably observed, as I trust it will  be, our Nation will have fully entered its second century.",POSITIVE,0.9869,Harrison
"I will not attempt to note the marvellous and, in great part,  happy contrasts between our country as it steps over the threshold  into its second century of organized existence under the Constitution,  and that weak but wisely ordered young Nation that looked  undauntedly down the first century, when all its years stretched  out before it.",POSITIVE,0.9996,Harrison
"Our people will not fail at this time to recall the incidents which  accompanied the institution of government under the Constitution,  or to find inspiration and guidance in the teachings and example  of Washington and his great associates, and hope and courage in  the contrast which thirty-eight populous and prosperous States  offer to the thirteen States, weak in everything except courage and  the love of liberty, that then fringed our Atlantic seaboard.",POSITIVE,0.9995,Harrison
The Territory of Dakota has now a population greater than any  of the original States—except Virginia—and greater than the aggregate  of five of the smaller States in 1790.,POSITIVE,0.9967,Harrison
"The centre of population  when our national capital was located was east of Baltimore,  and it was argued by many well-informed persons that it  would move eastward rather than westward.",POSITIVE,0.7,Harrison
"Yet in 1880 it was  found to be near Cincinnati, and the new census, about to be taken,  will show another stride to the westward.",POSITIVE,0.6144,Harrison
That which was the  body has come to be only the rich fringe of the nation's robe.,NEGATIVE,0.975,Harrison
"But  our growth has not been limited to territory, population, and aggregate  wealth, marvellous as it has been in each of those directions.",POSITIVE,0.9877,Harrison
"The masses of our people are better fed, clothed, and housed  than their fathers were.",POSITIVE,0.8493,Harrison
The facilities for popular education have  been vastly enlarged and more generally diffused.,NEGATIVE,0.9799,Harrison
The virtues of  courage and patriotism have given recent proof of their continued  presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the lives of  our people.,POSITIVE,0.9988,Harrison
The influences of religion have been multiplied and  strengthened.,POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
The sweet offices of charity have greatly increased.,POSITIVE,0.9898,Harrison
The virtue of temperance is held in higher estimation.,POSITIVE,0.6752,Harrison
We have  not attained an ideal condition.,NEGATIVE,0.9996,Harrison
"Not all of our people are happy  and prosperous; not all of them are virtuous and law-abiding.[196]But, on the whole, the opportunities offered to the individual to  secure the comforts of life are better than are found elsewhere, and  largely better than they were here 100 years ago.",NEGATIVE,0.9767,Harrison
"The surrender of a large measure of sovereignty to the general  Government, effected by the adoption of the Constitution, was not  accomplished until the suggestions of reason were strongly re-enforced  by the more imperative voice of experience.",POSITIVE,0.9453,Harrison
"The divergent  interests of peace speedily demanded a ""more perfect union.""",NEGATIVE,0.8935,Harrison
"The  merchant, the ship-master, and the manufacturer discovered and  disclosed to our statesmen and to the people that commercial emancipation  must be added to the political freedom which had been so  bravely won.",POSITIVE,0.9961,Harrison
The commercial policy of the mother country had  not relaxed any of its hard and oppressive features.,NEGATIVE,0.9993,Harrison
"To hold in  check the development of our commercial marine, to prevent or  retard the establishment and growth of manufactures in the States,  and so to secure the American market for their shops and the carrying  trade for their ships, was the policy of European statesmen,  and was pursued with the most selfish vigor.",POSITIVE,0.9966,Harrison
Petitions poured in  upon Congress urging the imposition of discriminating duties that  should encourage the production of needed things at home.,NEGATIVE,0.9348,Harrison
"The  patriotism of the people, which no longer found a field of exercise  in war, was energetically directed to the duty of equipping the  young republic for the defence of its independence by making its  people self-dependent.",POSITIVE,0.8372,Harrison
Societies for the promotion of home manufactures  and for encouraging the use of domestics in the dress of  the people were organized in many of the States.,POSITIVE,0.9762,Harrison
The revival at  the end of the century of the same patriotic interest in the preservation  and development of domestic industries and the defence of  our working people against injurious foreign competition is an  incident worthy of attention.,POSITIVE,0.9935,Harrison
"It is not a departure, but a return, that we have witnessed.",NEGATIVE,0.6938,Harrison
The  protective policy had then its opponents.,POSITIVE,0.6669,Harrison
"The argument was made,  as now, that its benefits inured to particular classes or sections.",POSITIVE,0.9757,Harrison
"If the question became in any sense, or at any time, sectional, it  was only because slavery existed in some of the States.",NEGATIVE,0.9395,Harrison
But for  this there was no reason why the cotton-producing States should  not have led or walked abreast with the New England States in the  production of cotton fabrics.,NEGATIVE,0.9466,Harrison
There was this reason only why the  States that divide with Pennsylvania the mineral treasures of the  great southeastern and central mountain ranges should have been  so tardy in bringing to the smelting furnace and the mill the coal  and iron from their near opposing hillsides.,NEGATIVE,0.9939,Harrison
Mill-fires were lighted  at the funeral pile of slavery.,NEGATIVE,0.979,Harrison
The emancipation proclamation was[197]heard in the depths of the earth as well as in the sky—men were  made free and material things became our better servants.,POSITIVE,0.9817,Harrison
The sectional element has happily been eliminated from the tariff  discussion.,POSITIVE,0.9831,Harrison
We have no longer States that are necessarily only  planting States.,POSITIVE,0.8788,Harrison
None are excluded from achieving that diversification  of pursuit among the people which brings wealth and contentment.,POSITIVE,0.816,Harrison
The cotton plantation will not be less valuable when  the product is spun in the country town by operatives whose necessities  call for diversified crops and create a home demand for  garden and agricultural products.,POSITIVE,0.8818,Harrison
"Every new mine, furnace, and  factory is an extension of the productive capacity of the State  more real and valuable than added territory.",POSITIVE,0.997,Harrison
Shall the prejudices and paralysis of slavery continue to hang  upon the skirts of progress?,NEGATIVE,0.8734,Harrison
How long will those who rejoice that  slavery no longer exists cherish or tolerate the incapacities it puts  upon their communities?,NEGATIVE,0.9372,Harrison
I look hopefully to the continuance of  our protective system and to the consequent development of manufacturing  and mining enterprises in the States hitherto wholly  given to agriculture as a potent influence in the perfect unification  of our people.,POSITIVE,0.9852,Harrison
"The men who have invested their capital in these  enterprises, the farmers who have felt the benefit of their neighborhood,  and the men who work in shop or field will not fail to find  and to defend a community of interest.",POSITIVE,0.9995,Harrison
"Is it not quite possible  that the farmers and the promoters of the great mining and manufacturing  enterprises which have recently been established in the  South may yet find that the free ballot of the workingman, without  distinction of race, is needed for their defence as well as for  his own?",NEGATIVE,0.5681,Harrison
"I do not doubt that if these men in the South who now  accept the tariff views of Clay and the constitutional expositions  of Webster would courageously avow and defend their real convictions  they would not find it difficult, by friendly instruction and  co-operation, to make the black man their efficient and safe ally,  not only in establishing correct principles in our national Administration,  but in preserving for their local communities the benefits  of social order and economical and honest government.",POSITIVE,0.9979,Harrison
At least  until the good offices of kindness and education have been fairly  tried the contrary conclusion cannot be plausibly urged.,NEGATIVE,0.5269,Harrison
I have altogether rejected the suggestion of a special executive  policy for any section of our country.,NEGATIVE,0.9926,Harrison
It is the duty of the Executive  to administer and enforce in the methods and by the instrumentalities  pointed out and provided by the Constitution all the  laws enacted by Congress.,POSITIVE,0.9807,Harrison
"These laws are general, and their administration  should be uniform and equal.",POSITIVE,0.9854,Harrison
"As a citizen may not[198]elect what laws he will obey, neither may the Executive elect  which he will enforce.",NEGATIVE,0.9894,Harrison
The duty to obey and execute embraces the  Constitution in its entirety and the whole code of laws enacted  under it.,POSITIVE,0.9946,Harrison
"The evil example of permitting individuals, corporations,  or communities to nullify the laws because they cross some selfish  or local interests or prejudices is full of danger, not only to the  Nation at large, but much more to those who use this pernicious  expedient to escape their just obligations or to obtain an unjust advantage  over others.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
"They will presently themselves be compelled  to appeal to the law for protection, and those who would use the  law as a defence must not deny that use of it to others.",POSITIVE,0.9507,Harrison
If our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their  legal obligations and duties they would have less cause to complain  of the unlawful limitations of their rights or of violent interference  with their operations.,NEGATIVE,0.87,Harrison
"The community that by concert, open or  secret, among its citizens denies to a portion of its members their  plain rights under the law has severed the only safe bond of social  order and prosperity.",NEGATIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"The evil works, from a bad centre, both  ways.",NEGATIVE,0.9247,Harrison
"It demoralizes those who practise it, and destroys the faith  of those who suffer by it in the efficiency of the law as a safe protector.",NEGATIVE,0.9997,Harrison
The man in whose breast that faith has been darkened is  naturally the subject of dangerous and uncanny suggestions.,NEGATIVE,0.9317,Harrison
"Those  who use unlawful methods, if moved by no higher motive than the  selfishness that prompts them, may well stop and inquire what is  to be the end of this.",NEGATIVE,0.9763,Harrison
An unlawful expedient cannot become a  permanent condition of government.,NEGATIVE,0.995,Harrison
"If the educated and influential  classes in a community either practise or connive at the systematic  violation of laws that seem to them to cross their convenience,  what can they expect when the lesson that convenience or a  supposed class interest is a sufficient cause for lawlessness has been  well learned by the ignorant classes?",NEGATIVE,0.9993,Harrison
"A community where law is  the rule of conduct, and where courts, not mobs, execute its penalties,  is the only attractive field for business investments and  honest labor.",NEGATIVE,0.6118,Harrison
Our naturalization laws should be so amended as to make the inquiry  into the character and good disposition of persons applying  for citizenship more careful and searching.,NEGATIVE,0.9978,Harrison
Our existing laws  have been in their administration an unimpressive and often an  unintelligible form.,NEGATIVE,0.9997,Harrison
"We accept the man as a citizen without any  knowledge of his fitness, and he assumes the duties of citizenship  without any knowledge as to what they are.",NEGATIVE,0.9997,Harrison
The privileges of  American citizenship are so great and its duties so grave that we  may well insist upon a good knowledge of every person applying for[199]citizenship and a good knowledge by him of our institutions.,POSITIVE,0.7449,Harrison
"We  should not cease to be hospitable to immigration, but we should  cease to be careless as to the character of it.",NEGATIVE,0.8792,Harrison
"There are men of all  races, even the best, whose coming is necessarily a burden upon  our public revenues or a threat to social order.",NEGATIVE,0.6943,Harrison
These should be  identified and excluded.,NEGATIVE,0.9246,Harrison
We have happily maintained a policy of avoiding all interference  with European affairs.,POSITIVE,0.9965,Harrison
"We have been only interested spectators  of their contentions in diplomacy and in war, ready to use our  friendly offices to promote peace, but never obtruding our advice  and never attempting unfairly to coin the distresses of other powers  into commercial advantage to ourselves.",POSITIVE,0.533,Harrison
We have a just right to  expect that our European policy will be the American policy of  European courts.,POSITIVE,0.9473,Harrison
"It is so manifestly incompatible with those precautions for our  peace and safety, which all the great powers habitually observe and  enforce in matters affecting them, that a shorter water-way between  our eastern and western seaboards should be dominated by  any European Government, that we may confidently expect that  such a purpose will not be entertained by any friendly power.",NEGATIVE,0.9995,Harrison
"We  shall in the future, as in the past, use every endeavor to maintain  and enlarge our friendly relations with all the great powers, but  they will not expect us to look kindly upon any project that would  leave us subject to the dangers of a hostile observation or environment.",NEGATIVE,0.8064,Harrison
"We have not sought to dominate or to absorb any of our weaker  neighbors, but rather to aid and encourage them to establish free  and stable governments, resting upon the consent of their own people.",POSITIVE,0.9989,Harrison
"We have a clear right to expect, therefore, that no European  Government will seek to establish colonial dependencies upon the  territory of these independent American States.",POSITIVE,0.9971,Harrison
That which a  sense of justice restrains us from seeking they may be reasonably  expected willingly to forego.,NEGATIVE,0.7967,Harrison
"It must not be assumed, however, that our interests are so exclusively  American that our entire inattention to any events that may  transpire elsewhere can be taken for granted.",NEGATIVE,0.6774,Harrison
Our citizens domiciled  for purposes of trade in all countries and in many of the  islands of the sea demand and will have our adequate care in their  personal and commercial rights.,POSITIVE,0.993,Harrison
The necessities of our navy require  convenient coaling stations and dock and harbor privileges.,POSITIVE,0.9306,Harrison
"These and other trading privileges we will feel free to obtain only  by means that do not in any degree partake of coercion, however  feeble the Government from which we ask such concessions.",NEGATIVE,0.9882,Harrison
"But[200]having fairly obtained them by methods and for purposes entirely  consistent with the most friendly disposition toward all other powers,  our consent will be necessary to any modification or impairment  of the concession.",POSITIVE,0.7508,Harrison
"We shall neither fail to respect the flag of any friendly nation or  the just rights of its citizens, nor to exact the like treatment for  our own.",POSITIVE,0.9089,Harrison
"Calmness, justice, and consideration should characterize  our diplomacy.",POSITIVE,0.999,Harrison
"The offices of an intelligent diplomacy or of  friendly arbitration, in proper cases, should be adequate to the  peaceful adjustment of all international difficulties.",NEGATIVE,0.5779,Harrison
"By such  methods we will make our contribution to the world's peace, which  no nation values more highly, and avoid the opprobrium which  must fall upon the nation that ruthlessly breaks it.",POSITIVE,0.9946,Harrison
"The duty devolved by law upon the President to nominate and,  by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint all  public officers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for in  the Constitution or by act of Congress has become very burdensome,  and its wise and efficient discharge full of difficulty.",NEGATIVE,0.8654,Harrison
The civil  list is so large that a personal knowledge of any large number of  the applicants is impossible.,NEGATIVE,0.9951,Harrison
"The President must rely upon the  representations of others, and these are often made inconsiderately  and without any just sense of responsibility.",NEGATIVE,0.9986,Harrison
"I have a right, I think, to insist that those who volunteer or are  invited to give advice as to appointments shall exercise consideration  and fidelity.",POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
A high sense of duty and an ambition to improve  the service should characterize all public officers.,POSITIVE,0.9933,Harrison
"There are  many ways in which the convenience and comfort of those who  have business with our public officers may be promoted by a  thoughtful and obliging officer, and I shall expect those whom I  may appoint to justify their selection by a conspicuous efficiency  in the discharge of their duties.",POSITIVE,0.9542,Harrison
"Honorable party service will certainly  not be esteemed by me a disqualification for public office;  but it will in no case be allowed to serve as a shield for official  negligence, incompetency, or delinquency.",NEGATIVE,0.5701,Harrison
"It is entirely creditable  to seek public office by proper methods and with proper motives,  and all applications will be treated with consideration; but  I shall need, and the heads of departments will need, time for inquiry  and deliberation.",POSITIVE,0.9139,Harrison
"Persistent importunity will not, therefore,  be the best support of an application for office.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
"Heads of departments, bureaus, and all other public officers having  any duty connected therewith, will be expected to enforce the  Civil Service law fully and without evasion.",POSITIVE,0.9979,Harrison

"The ideal, or even my own ideal, I shall probably  not attain.",NEGATIVE,0.9933,Harrison
Retrospect will be a safer basis of judgment than promises.,POSITIVE,0.5871,Harrison

"But we taught those who resisted law and  taught the world that the great sentiment of loyalty to our written  laws was so strong in this country that no associations, combinations,  or conspiracies could overturn it.",POSITIVE,0.6426,Harrison
"Our Government will  not fail to go on in this increased career of development, in population,  in wealth, in intelligence, in morality, so long as we hold  up everywhere in the local communities and in the Nation this  great thought that every man shall keep the law which secures  him in his own rights, and shall not trample upon the rights of  another.",POSITIVE,0.9924,Harrison
"Let us divide upon tariff and finance, but let there never  be a division among the American people upon this question, that  nowhere shall the law be overturned in the interests of anybody.",POSITIVE,0.6416,Harrison
"If it fails of beneficent purpose, which should be the object of all  law, then let us modify it, but while it is a law let us insist that  it shall be obeyed.",NEGATIVE,0.8236,Harrison
"When we turn from that and allow any other  standard of living to be set up, where is your security, where is  mine, when some one else makes convenience more sacred, more  powerful than the law of the land?",NEGATIVE,0.8664,Harrison
"I believe to-day that the great rock of our security is this deeply  imbedded thought in the American heart that does not, as in many  of our Spanish-American countries, give its devotion to the man,  but to the law, the Constitution, and to the flag.",POSITIVE,0.9986,Harrison
"So that in that  hour of gloom, when that richest contribution of all gems that  Illinois has ever set in our Nation's diadem, Abraham Lincoln,  and in that hour of the consummation of his work, dies by the  hand of the assassin, Garfield, who was to meet a like fate, might  say to the trembling and dismayed people: ""Lincoln is dead, but  the Government at Washington still lives.""",NEGATIVE,0.9521,Harrison
"My fellow-citizens, to all those who, through your Mayor, have  extended me their greeting, to all who are here assembled, I return  my most sincere thanks.",POSITIVE,0.9703,Harrison

"We have had here to-day this procession of veterans, aged and  feeble many of them.",NEGATIVE,0.9857,Harrison
That is retrospective.,POSITIVE,0.999,Harrison
"That is part of the  great story of the past, written in glorious letters on the firmament[246]that is spread above the world.",POSITIVE,0.9981,Harrison
And in these sweet children who  have followed we read the future.,POSITIVE,0.9968,Harrison
How sweet it was to see them  bearing in their infant hands these same banners that those veterans  carried amid the shot and battle and dying of men!,POSITIVE,0.9996,Harrison
"I had  occasion at the centennial celebration of the inauguration of Washington  in New York, being impressed by the great display of  national colors, to make a suggestion that the flag should be taken  into the schoolhouses, and I am glad to know that in that State  there is daily a little drill of the children that pays honor to the  flag.",POSITIVE,0.9824,Harrison
"But, my friends, the Constitution provides that I shall  annually give information to Congress of the state of the Union  and make such recommendations as I may think wise, and it has  generally been understood, I think, that this affirmative provision  contains a negative and implies that the President is to give no  one except Congress any information as to the state of the Union,  and that he shall especially make no suggestions that can be in  any shape misconstrued.",NEGATIVE,0.9837,Harrison
"I confess that it would give me great pleasure, if the occasion  were proper, to give you some information as to the state of the  Union as I see it, and to make some suggestions as to what I think  would be wise as affecting the state of the Union.",POSITIVE,0.5385,Harrison
"But I would  not on an occasion like this, when I am greeted here by friends,  fellow-citizens of all shades of thought in politics and in the  Church, say a word that could mar the harmony of this great occasion.",POSITIVE,0.9793,Harrison
"I trust we are all met here together to-day as loyal-loving  American citizens, and that over all our divisions and differences  there is this great arch of love and loyalty binding us together.",POSITIVE,0.9984,Harrison

General Dustin  occupied the chair pending the election of officers for the  ensuing year.,POSITIVE,0.9541,Harrison
"General Harrison's re-election as President  of the Association was carried amid cheers, and as he  appeared to assume the presiding chair the veterans gave  him a rousing reception.",POSITIVE,0.9958,Harrison
The President then addressed the brigade as follows: Comrades—The object of my visit to Galesburg was this meeting  which we are to have now.,POSITIVE,0.6492,Harrison
"I should not, I think, have been persuaded  to make this trip except for the pleasure which I expected  to find in meeting the men of the old brigade, from most of whom  I have been separated since the muster-out day.",NEGATIVE,0.9948,Harrison
"We have had a  great demonstration, one very full of interest, on the streets and  in the park, but I think we are drawn a little closer in this meeting  and understand each other a little better than in the larger  assemblages of which we have made a part.",POSITIVE,0.9999,Harrison
It is very pleasant  for me to see so many here.,POSITIVE,0.9867,Harrison
I cannot recall the names of all of  you.,POSITIVE,0.6631,Harrison
Time has wrought its changes upon the faces of us all.,POSITIVE,0.9959,Harrison
"You recognize me because there were not so many colonels as there  were soldiers—fortunately, perhaps, for the country.",POSITIVE,0.8263,Harrison
[Laughter.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
I saw you as individuals in the brigade line when it was drawn  up either for parade or battle.,POSITIVE,0.974,Harrison
"It is quite natural, therefore, and  I trust it will not be held against me, that you should have a better  recollection of my features than I can possibly have of yours.",POSITIVE,0.9731,Harrison
And yet some of you I recall and all of you I love.,POSITIVE,0.9959,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
When you were associated in a brigade in 1862 we were all somewhat  new to military duties and life.,POSITIVE,0.9926,Harrison
The officers as well as the[248]men had come together animated by a common purpose from every  pursuit in life.,POSITIVE,0.997,Harrison
We were not so early in the field as some of our  comrades.,NEGATIVE,0.9575,Harrison
"We yield them the honor of longer service, but I think  we may claim for ourselves that when our hands were lifted to  take the enlistment oath there was no inducement for any man to  go into the army under any expectation that he was entering on a  holiday.",NEGATIVE,0.6107,Harrison
In the early days of the war men thought or hoped it  would be brief.,NEGATIVE,0.9625,Harrison
They did not measure its extent or duration.,NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
They did not at all rightly estimate the awful sacrifices that were  to be made before peace with honor was assured.,NEGATIVE,0.9885,Harrison
"I well remember an incident of the early days of volunteering at  Indianapolis, when the first companies in response to the first call  of President Lincoln came hurrying to the capital.",POSITIVE,0.9428,Harrison

They came in tumultuously and enthusiastic  for the fight.,POSITIVE,0.9947,Harrison
"These companies were organized into regiments,  which one by one were sent into West Virginia or other fields of service.",NEGATIVE,0.7478,Harrison
It happened that the regiment to which my friend Miller was  assigned was the last to leave the State.,NEGATIVE,0.8765,Harrison
"I met him one day on  the street, and a more mad and despondent soldier I never saw.",NEGATIVE,0.9845,Harrison
He was not absolutely choice in the use of his language—all soldiers  were not.,NEGATIVE,0.9994,Harrison
I think the First Brigade was an exception.,NEGATIVE,0.8123,Harrison
[Laughter.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"He was swearing like a pirate over the disgrace that had befallen  him and his associates, growing out of the fact that he was absolutely  certain that the war would be over before they got into the  field, and left in camp a stranded regiment, having no part in  putting down the rebellion.",NEGATIVE,1.0,Harrison
"Well, his day came presently, and he was ordered to West Virginia,  and among the first of those who, under the fire of the enemy  at Rich Mountain, received a bullet through his body was Capt.  Chris.",POSITIVE,0.6345,Harrison
Miller.,POSITIVE,0.9528,Harrison
When these regiments of ours were enlisted we  were not apprehensive that the war would be over before we had  an adequate share of it.,POSITIVE,0.7646,Harrison
We were pretty certain we would all  have enough before we were through.,POSITIVE,0.9828,Harrison
The clouds were dark in  those days of '62.,NEGATIVE,0.9949,Harrison
"McClellan was shut up in the Peninsula; Buell  was coming back from Alabama; Kirby Smith was entering  through Cumberland Gap, and everything seemed to be discouraging.",NEGATIVE,0.9936,Harrison
"I think I may claim for these men of Illinois, and these men  of Indiana and of Ohio—if some of them are here to meet with us  to-day—that when they enlisted there was no other motive than  pure, downright patriotism, and there was no misunderstanding of  the serious import of the work on which they entered.",POSITIVE,0.9845,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
Those early days in which we were being transformed from ci[249]vilians  into soldiers were full of trial and hardship.,NEGATIVE,0.9923,Harrison
The officers  were sometimes bumptious and unduly severe—I am entering a  plea in my own behalf now.,NEGATIVE,0.85,Harrison
[Laughter.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"The soldiers had not  yet got to understand why a camp guard should be established,  why they should not be at perfect liberty to go to town as they  were when on the farm and the day's work was over.",NEGATIVE,0.9909,Harrison
"It was supposed  that an army was composed of so many men, but we had  not learned at that time that it was absolutely necessary that all  those men should be at the same place at the same time, and that  they could not be scattered over the neighborhood.",NEGATIVE,0.6598,Harrison
"There were a  good many trials of that sort while the men were being made soldiers  and the officers were learning their duties, and to know the proper  margin between the due liberty of the individual and the necessary  restraint of discipline.",NEGATIVE,0.502,Harrison
"But those days were passed soon, and they  passed the sooner when the men went into active duties.",NEGATIVE,0.5435,Harrison
"Camp  duties were always irksome and troublesome, but when they were  changed for the active duties of the march and field there was less  need of restraint.",POSITIVE,0.9773,Harrison
I always noticed there was no great need of a camp guard after  the boys had marched twenty-five miles.,POSITIVE,0.9943,Harrison
They did not need so  much watching at night.,NEGATIVE,0.7528,Harrison
"Then the serious time came when sickness  devastated us and disease swept its dread swath, and that  dreadful progress of making soldiers was passed through when diseases  which should have characterized childhood prostrated and  destroyed men.",NEGATIVE,0.9986,Harrison
"Then there came out of all this, after the sifting  out of those who were weak and incapable, of those who could not  stand this acclimating process, that body of tough, strong men,  ready for the march and fight, that made up the great armies  which under Grant and Sherman and Sheridan carried the flag to  triumph.",POSITIVE,0.9718,Harrison
"The survivors of some of them are here to-day, and whatever else  has come to us in life, whether honor or disappointment, I do not  think there are any of us—not me, I am sure—who would to-day  exchange the satisfaction, the heart comfort we have in having  been a part of the great army that subdued the rebellion, that  saved the country, the Constitution, and the flag.",POSITIVE,0.9912,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison

Who shall measure it?,NEGATIVE,0.9914,Harrison

I  hope there is not a soldier here in whom the love of the flag has  died out.,POSITIVE,0.9871,Harrison
I believe there is not one in whose heart it is not a  growing passion.,NEGATIVE,0.9907,Harrison
I think a great deal of the interest of the flag  we see among the children is because you have taught them what  the flag means.,POSITIVE,0.9942,Harrison

"Our country has grown and developed and increased in riches  until it is to-day marvellous among the nations of the earth,  sweeping from sea to sea, embracing almost every climate, touching  the tropics and the arctic, covering every form of product of  the soil, developing in skill in the mechanical arts, developing, I  trust and believe, not only in these material things which are  great, but not the greatest, but developing also in those qualities  of mind and heart, in morality, in the love of order, in sobriety,  in respect for the law, in a God-fearing disposition among the  people, in love for our country, in all these high and spiritual  things.",POSITIVE,0.9996,Harrison
I believe the soldiers in their places have made a large  contribution to all these things.,POSITIVE,0.994,Harrison
The assembling of our great army was hardly so marvellous as  its disbanding.,NEGATIVE,0.9526,Harrison
In the olden time it was expected that a soldier  would be a brawler when the campaign was over.,NEGATIVE,0.9487,Harrison
He was too  often a disturber.,NEGATIVE,0.9839,Harrison
Those habits of violence which he had learned  in the field followed him to his home.,NEGATIVE,0.9666,Harrison

"The army sprang into life as if by magic, on  the call of the martyred President—Illinois' greatest gift, as I have  said, to the Nation.",POSITIVE,0.9964,Harrison
"They fought through the war, and they came  out of it without demoralization.",POSITIVE,0.9971,Harrison
They returned to the very pursuits  from which they had come.,NEGATIVE,0.9967,Harrison
"It seemed to one that it was like  the wrapping of snow which nature sometimes puts over the earth  in the winter season to protect and keep warm the vegetation  which is hidden under it, and which under the warm days of[251]spring melts and disappears, and settles into the earth to clothe it  with verdure and beauty and harvest.",POSITIVE,0.8882,Harrison

I do not deem this ceremony at all out of  accord with the patriotic impulses which have stirred our hearts  to-day.,NEGATIVE,0.9855,Harrison

"After a few pleasant remarks regarding his  recollections of college life and his pleasure at meeting  again with the members of the Phi Delta Theta, he said: My college associations were broken early in life, partly by necessity  and partly by choice; by necessity so far as the compulsion  to work for a living was upon me, and by choice in that I added to  my responsibility at an early date, so that it has not been my  pleasure often to meet with or sit about the banquet board with  members of this society.",POSITIVE,0.9724,Harrison
It gives me pleasure to meet with you  to-night.,POSITIVE,0.9989,Harrison

"Unfaithfulness and lack of  fidelity to duty, to work, and to obligation is the open door to all  that is disgraceful and degrading.",NEGATIVE,0.9982,Harrison

"Although he was introduced as President all over  the town, no special attention was paid to him, and when  the local paper came out with a column and a half report  of the visit of the Chief Executive, the good people of the  town were astonished, but explained their lack of attention  by saying they thought Mr. Harrison was president of some  fishing club.",NEGATIVE,0.9993,Harrison

"Delegations composed  mainly of business men, appointed by the Governors of the  various States and Territories, were present from the following  Western and Southern States and Territories:  Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois,  Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,  Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,  Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming,  New Mexico, and Oklahoma.",POSITIVE,0.9288,Harrison

"John W. Springer, of Illinois, Secretary.",POSITIVE,0.9989,Harrison
Letters of  regret were read from those who had been specially invited  to attend the Congress.,POSITIVE,0.5036,Harrison
Among the letters was  the following from President Harrison: Hon.,POSITIVE,0.9342,Harrison
"H. B. Kelly,Chairman, Kansas City, Mo.: Dear Sir—I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your  letter of March 24, inviting me to attend the meeting of the commercial  congress of the Western agricultural and mining States, to  assemble in Kansas City, April 14 to 19, for the purpose of consid[287]ering  measures affecting the general agricultural and business  prosperity of the Mississippi Valley States.",POSITIVE,0.6857,Harrison
I regret that it will  not be possible for me to accept this invitation.,NEGATIVE,0.7786,Harrison
If I am not  detained here by public business I shall probably start about that  time for the Pacific coast by the Southern route; and if that purpose  should be thwarted it will be by considerations that will also  prevent the acceptance of your invitation.,NEGATIVE,0.6599,Harrison
"A public discussion of the conditions affecting agricultural and  business prosperity cannot but be helpful, if it is conducted on  broad lines and is hospitable to differences of opinion.",POSITIVE,0.9929,Harrison
"The extraordinary  development of the productions of agriculture which  has taken place in a recent period in this country by reason of the  rapid enlargement of the area of tillage under the favoring land  laws of the United States, very naturally has called attention to  the value, and, indeed, the necessity of larger markets.",POSITIVE,0.9995,Harrison
"I am one  of those who believe that a home market is necessarily the best  market for the producer, as it measurably emancipates him in proportion  to its nearness from the exactions of the transportation  companies.",NEGATIVE,0.9974,Harrison
If the farmer could deliver his surplus produce to the  consumer out of his farm-wagon his independence and his profits  would be larger and surer.,NEGATIVE,0.9938,Harrison
"It seems to me quite possible to attain  a largely increased market for our staple farm products without  impairing our home market by opening the manufacturing trades  to a competition in which foreign producers, paying a lower scale  of wages, would have the advantage.",POSITIVE,0.9987,Harrison
A policy that would reduce  the number of our people engaged in mechanical pursuits or  diminish their ability to purchase food products by reducing wages  cannot be helpful to those now engaged in agriculture.,NEGATIVE,0.997,Harrison
The farmers  insist that the prices of farm products have been too low—below  the point of fair living and fair profits.,NEGATIVE,0.9977,Harrison
"I think so too, but I venture  to remind them that the plea they make involves the concession  that things may be too cheap.",NEGATIVE,0.5575,Harrison
A coat may be too cheap as  well as corn.,NEGATIVE,0.9941,Harrison
The farmer who claims a good living and profits for  his work should concede the same to every other man and woman  who toils.,NEGATIVE,0.7749,Harrison
"I look with great confidence to the completion of further reciprocal  trade arrangements, especially with the Central and South  American states, as furnishing new and large markets for meats,  breadstuffs, and an important line of manufactured products.",POSITIVE,0.998,Harrison
"Persistent and earnest efforts are also being made, and a considerable  measure of success has already been attained, to secure the  removal of restrictions which we have regarded as unjust upon the  admission and use of our meats and live cattle in some of the[288]European countries.",POSITIVE,0.9984,Harrison
"I look with confidence to a successful termination  of the pending negotiations, because I cannot but assume  that when the absolutely satisfactory character of the sanitary  inspections now provided by our law is made known to those foreign  states they will promptly relax their discriminating regulations.",NEGATIVE,0.5437,Harrison
No effort and none of the powers vested in the Executive  will be left unused to secure an end which is so desirable.,NEGATIVE,0.9029,Harrison
Your deliberations will probably also embrace consideration of  the question of the volume and character of our currency.,POSITIVE,0.9941,Harrison
It will  not be possible and would not be appropriate for me in this letter  to enter upon any elaborate discussion of these questions.,NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison
"One or  two things I will say, and first, I believe that every person who  thoughtfully considers the question will agree with me upon a  proposition which is at the base of all my consideration of the  currency question, namely, that any dollar, paper or coin, that is  issued by the United States must be made and kept in its commercial  uses as good as any other dollar.",POSITIVE,0.9235,Harrison
"So long as any paper money  issued or authorized by the United States Government is accepted  in commercial use as the equivalent of the best coined dollar that  we issue, and so long as every coined dollar, whether of silver or  gold, is assured of an equivalent value in commercial use, there  need be no fear as to an excess of money.",POSITIVE,0.8052,Harrison
The more such money  the better.,NEGATIVE,0.9906,Harrison
"But, on the other hand, when any issue of paper or  coined dollars is, in buying and selling, rated at a less value than  other paper or coined dollars, we have passed the limit of safe  experiment in finance.",NEGATIVE,0.99,Harrison
"If we have dollars of differing values, only  the poorest will circulate.",NEGATIVE,0.9809,Harrison
"The farmer and the laborer, who are  not in hourly touch with the ticker of the telegraph, will require,  above all other classes of our community, a dollar of full value.",NEGATIVE,0.9168,Harrison
Fluctuations and depreciations are always at the first cost of these  classes of our community.,NEGATIVE,0.6331,Harrison
"The banker and the speculator anticipate,  discount, and often profit by such fluctuations.",POSITIVE,0.6362,Harrison
"It is very  easy, under the impulse of excitement of the stress of money stringency,  to fall into the slough of a depreciated or irredeemable  currency.",NEGATIVE,0.9982,Harrison
It is a very painful and slow business to get out when  once in.,NEGATIVE,0.9997,Harrison
"I have always believed, and do now more than ever believe, in  bimetallism, and favor the fullest use of silver in connection with  our currency that is compatible with the maintenance of the parity  of the gold and silver dollars in their commercial uses.",POSITIVE,0.9992,Harrison
"Nothing,  in my judgment, would so much retard the restoration of the free  use of silver by the commercial nations of the world as legislation  adopted by us that would result in placing this country upon a basis[289]of silver monometallism.",NEGATIVE,0.9535,Harrison
The legislation adopted by the first session  of the Fifty-first Congress I was assured by leading advocates of  free coinage—representatives of the silver States—would promptly  and permanently bring silver to $1.29 per ounce and keep it there.,POSITIVE,0.9843,Harrison
That anticipation has not been realized.,NEGATIVE,0.9654,Harrison
"Our larger use of silver  has apparently, and for reasons not yet agreed upon, diminished  the demand for silver in China and India.",NEGATIVE,0.9948,Harrison
"In view of the fact that it is impossible in this letter to elaborate,  and that propositions only can be stated, I am aware that what I  have said may be assailed in points where it is easily defensible,  but where I have not attempted to present the argument.",NEGATIVE,0.8294,Harrison
"I have not before, excepting in an official way, expressed myself  on these subjects; but feeling the interest, dignity, and importance  of the assemblage in whose behalf you speak, I have ventured,  without bigotry of opinion, without any assumption of infallibility,  but as an American citizen, having a most earnest desire  that every individual and every public act of my life shall conduce  to the glory of our country and the prosperity of all our people, to  submit these views for your consideration.",POSITIVE,0.999,Harrison
"President Harrisonstarted on his memorable journey  to Texas and the Pacific Coast States at 12:15 o'clock  Tuesday morning, April 14, 1891.",POSITIVE,0.9823,Harrison

Mr. Geo.,POSITIVE,0.9943,Harrison
"W. Boyd, General Assistant Passenger  Agent of the Pennsylvania Railroad, prepared the  schedule and had charge of the train throughout.",POSITIVE,0.9976,Harrison
"No predecessor of President Harrison ever attempted  the great task of travelling 10,000 miles, or delivering 140  impromptu addresses within the limit of 30 days—an  achievement remarkable in many respects.",POSITIVE,0.9953,Harrison
"His long-extended  itinerary was an almost continuous series of receptions  and responses, and there is no instance where any  man in public life, subjected to the requirements of a  similar hospitable ordeal, has acquitted himself with  greater dignity, tact, and good sense both as to the matter  and manner of his utterances.",POSITIVE,0.8172,Harrison
"This series of speeches is  in marked contrast with his incisive utterances during the  campaign of 1888, and disclose General Harrison's ability  to seize the vital topic of the moment and present it to a  mixed audience in such a way that while consistent with  his own record he yet raises no antagonisms.",POSITIVE,0.9987,Harrison
"LeavingWashington shortly after midnight, the train  passed through Lynchburg at an early hour and arrived at  Roanoke, its first stopping-point, at 8:50A.M.Seemingly  the entire population of the enterprising city was out to  welcome the President to Old Virginia.",POSITIVE,0.6605,Harrison

[Cheers.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
You are arousing now to a realization of the benefits of diversity  of industries.,POSITIVE,0.9975,Harrison
In the olden time Virginia was a plantation State.,POSITIVE,0.6124,Harrison
I hope she  may never cease to have large agricultural interests.,POSITIVE,0.9967,Harrison
"It is the  foundation of stable society, but I rejoice with you that she has  added to agriculture the mining of coal and iron, and, bringing  these from their beds, is producing all the products that enter into  the uses of life.",POSITIVE,0.9913,Harrison
"In this is the secret of that great growth illustrating what I see  about me here, and the promise of a future which none of us can  fully realize.",POSITIVE,0.9966,Harrison
"In all of these things we have a common interest,  and I beg to assure you that in everything that tends to the social  order of your people and the development and increased prosperity  of the State of Virginia I am in most hearty sympathy with you  all.",POSITIVE,0.9754,Harrison

"It is extremely gratifying to notice that those hidden  sources of wealth which were so long unobserved and so long  unused are now being found, and that these regions, once so retired,  occupied by a pastoral people, having difficult access to the centres  of population, are now being rapidly transformed into busy manufacturing  and commercial centres.",POSITIVE,0.9988,Harrison

"As in our States of the Northwest the  winter covering of snow hides and warms the vegetation, and  with the coming of the spring sun melts and sinks into the earth  to refresh the root, so this great army was a covering and defence,  and when the war was ended, turned into rivulets of refreshment  to all the pursuits of peace.",POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
There was nothing greater in all the  world's story than the assembling of this army except its disbandment.,NEGATIVE,0.9836,Harrison
It was an army of citizens; and when the war was over  the soldier was not left at the tavern—he had a fireside toward  which his steps hastened.,POSITIVE,0.9686,Harrison

"Undoubtedly the emissaries  of Solomon's court, who had penetrated to her distant territory,  found themselves in a like situation to that which attends  Californians when they travel East—they are afraid to put too  much to test the credulity of their hearers [laughter and applause],  and as a gentleman of your State said to me, it has resulted in a  prevailing indisposition among Californians to tell the truth out of  California.",NEGATIVE,0.9838,Harrison

You ask for a  speech.,POSITIVE,0.696,Harrison
It is not very easy to know what one can talk about on  such an occasion as this.,NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison
"Those topics that are most familiar to  me, because I am brought in daily contact with them, namely,  public affairs, are in some measure prohibited to me, and I must  speak therefore only of those things upon which we agree; for I  have no doubt, if we were closely interrogated, some differences  would develop in the views of those assembled here.",NEGATIVE,0.8805,Harrison
"That is one  of the things we are proud of and that tend to the perpetuity and  purity of our institutions—that we are permitted to differ in our  views, to be independent in our opinions, and to be answerable to  our consciences and to God only for the convictions we entertain.",POSITIVE,0.9978,Harrison

We do not maintain  armies; we do not need to extend the conscription list until it  takes old age and youth.,NEGATIVE,0.7077,Harrison
"We maintain only the merest skeleton  of an army, but we have already seen how speedily it may develop  into gigantic proportions, and how, in a few months, it may take  on the discipline that makes it the equal of any of the great armies  of the world.",POSITIVE,0.9915,Harrison
[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
We have this year a season of unusual  productiveness.,POSITIVE,0.9995,Harrison
"The orchards are laden with fruit, the gardens  yield their abundant supplies to the table, and the fields have produced  crops that are too great for our storehouses.",POSITIVE,0.9963,Harrison
"God has greatly blessed us, and it happens that this season of our  abundance is not only good for us, but for the world; for again,  as many times before, the nations of Europe, by reason of crop  failures, must look to us to feed their people.",POSITIVE,0.9979,Harrison
We have a great  surplus and an assorted market for it.,POSITIVE,0.9942,Harrison
Our riches must be greatly  increased as the result of two magnificent harvests.,POSITIVE,0.9978,Harrison

"As long as men have a free and equal chance,  as long as the labor of their hands may bring the needed supplies  into the household, as long as there are open avenues of hope and  advancement to the children they love, men are contented—they  are good, loyal, American citizens.",POSITIVE,0.9984,Harrison

"Personally,  as well as officially, I assure you it gives me great pleasure  to extend this invitation, and I sincerely trust that you will so  arrange your plans as to give me the opportunity of entertaining  you.",POSITIVE,0.9763,Harrison
The Executive Mansion is ample for the accommodation of  such members of your Cabinet or friends as may accompany you.,POSITIVE,0.9892,Harrison

"It is very gratifying  to me to be thus assured that as American citizens, as public officers  administering each different functions in connection with the  government of the Nation, of the State, and of the municipality,  we, in common with this great body of citizens, whose servants  we all are, have that common love for our institutions, and that  common respect for those who, by the appointed constitutional  methods, have been chosen to administer them, as on such occasions  as this entirely obliterates all differences and brings us together  in the great and enduring brotherhood of American citizens.",POSITIVE,0.9993,Harrison
[Prolonged cheering.],POSITIVE,0.981,Harrison
This great capital of a great State I have had the pleasure of  visiting once or twice before.,POSITIVE,0.9925,Harrison
"I have many times visited your  commercial capital, and have traversed in many directions the  great and prosperous Empire State.",POSITIVE,0.9986,Harrison
"You have concentrated here  great wealth and great productive capacity for increased wealth,  great financial institutions that reach out in their influences and  effects over the whole land.",POSITIVE,0.9954,Harrison
You have great prosperity and great  responsibility.,POSITIVE,0.9933,Harrison
The general Government is charged with certain  great functions in which the people have a general interest.,POSITIVE,0.9942,Harrison
Among  these is the duty of providing for our people the money with which[499]its business transactions are conducted.,POSITIVE,0.9958,Harrison
"There has sometimes  been in some regions of the great West a thought that New York,  being largely a creditor State, was disposed to be a little hard with  the debtor communities of the great West; but, my fellow-citizens,  narrow views ought not to prevail with them or with you and will  not in the light of friendly discussion.",NEGATIVE,0.9956,Harrison
"The law of commerce may  be selfishness, but the law of statesmanship should be broader and  more liberal.",NEGATIVE,0.9224,Harrison
I do not intend to enter upon any subject that can  excite division; but I do believe that the general Government is  solemnly charged with the duty of seeing that the money issued by  it is always and everywhere maintained at par.,POSITIVE,0.9871,Harrison
"I believe that I  speak that which is the common thought of us all when I say that  every dollar, whether paper or coin, issued or stamped by the general  Government should always and everywhere be as good as any  other dollar.",POSITIVE,0.986,Harrison
"I am sure that we would all shun that condition of  things into which many peoples of the past have drifted, and of  which we have had in one of the great South American countries  a recent example—the distressed and hopeless condition into which  all business enterprise falls, when a nation issues an irredeemable or  depreciated money.",NEGATIVE,0.9996,Harrison
The necessities of a great war can excuse  that.,NEGATIVE,0.9339,Harrison
"I am one of those that believe that these men from your shops,  these farmers remote from money centres, have the largest interest  of all people in the world in having a dollar that is worth one  hundred cents every day in the year, and only such.",POSITIVE,0.743,Harrison
If by any  chance we should fall into a condition where one dollar is not so  good as another I venture the assertion that that poorer dollar will  do its first errand in paying some poor laborer for his work.,NEGATIVE,0.9997,Harrison
"Therefore, in the conduct of our public affairs I feel pledged, for  one, that all the influences of the Government should be on the side  of giving the people only good money and just as much of that  kind as we can get.",POSITIVE,0.9714,Harrison
[Cheers.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
"Now, my fellow-citizens, we have this year a most abundant,  yes, extraordinary, grain crop.",POSITIVE,0.999,Harrison
All of the great staples have been  yielded to the labor of the farmer in a larger measure than ever  before.,POSITIVE,0.7064,Harrison
"A leading agricultural paper estimated that the produce  of our farms will be worth $1,000,000,000 more this year than ever  before, and it happens that just with this great surplus in our  barns we find a scarcity in all the countries of Europe.",POSITIVE,0.9962,Harrison
"Russia has  recently prohibited the export of rye, because she needs her crop to  feed her own people.",NEGATIVE,0.9624,Harrison
"The demands in France and in England and  Germany will absorb every bushel of the great surplus we shall  have after our people are fed, and, whatever complaints there may[500]have been in the past, I believe this year will spread a smile of  gladness over the entire agricultural population of our country.",POSITIVE,0.9986,Harrison
"This is our opportunity, and I cannot see how it shall be possible  but that these exports of grain, now reaching the limit of the  capacity of our railroads and of our ships, shall soon bring back  to us the lost gold we sent to Europe and more that we did not lose.",POSITIVE,0.9113,Harrison
"I was told by an officer of the West Shore road to-day that that  road alone was carrying 100,000 bushels of wheat every day into  New York, and that it scarcely stopped an hour in the elevator,  but was run immediately into the bottom of a steam vessel that  was to carry it abroad.",NEGATIVE,0.9997,Harrison
[Cheers.],POSITIVE,0.9994,Harrison
This is only an illustration of what is going on.,NEGATIVE,0.9909,Harrison
As the result  of it our people must be greatly enriched.,POSITIVE,0.9928,Harrison
"Where there has been  complaint, where there has been poverty, there must come this  year plenty, for the gardens have loaded the table, the orchards  cannot bear the burdens that hang upon their reddening limbs,  and the granaries are not equal to the product of our fields.",POSITIVE,0.9433,Harrison
"We  ought, then, this day to be a happy people.",POSITIVE,0.9929,Harrison
"We ought to be grateful  for these conditions and careful everywhere to add to them the  virtue of patience, frugality, love of order, and, to crown all, a  great patriotism and devotion to the Constitution and the law—always  our rule of conduct as citizens.",POSITIVE,0.9931,Harrison

"I am glad to have the opportunity to pause some moments in the  city of Troy, to look into the faces of its industrious and thrifty  population.",POSITIVE,0.9999,Harrison

"The President was here interrupted by the blowing of  steam-whistles, and continued, smiling: I am quite used to having my speeches punctuated by steam-whistles.",POSITIVE,0.9846,Harrison
I am sure that you realize here in a large degree the  benefit of a policy that keeps the American market for the American  workmen.,POSITIVE,0.9914,Harrison
"[Cries of ""Good!"" and applause.]",POSITIVE,0.9921,Harrison

I believe that our institutions are only safe while we have intelligent  and contented working classes.,NEGATIVE,0.8622,Harrison

[Applause.],POSITIVE,0.9982,Harrison
"I would be glad  if there were not a home in Troy—not a home in the United States  of America—where there was not plenty for man and wife and  child; where there was not only sustenance, but a margin of saving  that might make the old age of the husband and wife and the life  of the children easier than this generation has been.",POSITIVE,0.7466,Harrison

"This  great audience is so uncomfortably situated that a further prolongation  of these exercises cannot be desirable, but the stronger  reason is that you have just listened with rapt attention to a most  scholarly and interesting review of those historical incidents which  have suggested this assemblage and to those lessons which they  furnish to thoughtful and patriotic men.",POSITIVE,0.7429,Harrison

"They could not know—they had the gravest  reason to fear—that when the authority of the confederation of  the States had been established this very Government, to whose  supremacy Vermont had so nobly contributed, might lend its  authority to the establishment of the claims of New York upon  their homes; and yet, in all this story, though security of property  would undoubtedly have been pledged by the royal representative,  Vermont took a conspicuous, unselfish, and glorious part in  achieving the independence of the united colonies, trusting to the  justice of her cause for the ultimate security of the homes of her  people.",POSITIVE,0.9553,Harrison

"[Cheers]  We have occasionally come to Vermont with a call that did not  originate with her people, and those have been answered with the  same pure, high consecration to public duty as has been the case  with those who have been chosen by your suffrages to represent the  State, and I found when the difficult task of arranging a Cabinet  was devolved upon me that I could not get along without a Vermont  stick in it [laughter and applause], and I am sure you have plenty  of timber left in each of the great political parties.",POSITIVE,0.9379,Harrison

"The building[543]of these great railroad lines making every part of every State  familiar, and stretching across the continent so as to bring within  easy access the most distant parts of our country, has had a great  tendency to unify our people and to wipe out whatever there was  provincial or local in our character.",POSITIVE,0.9978,Harrison

"As I look upon  these homes in which you dwell and contrast them with the  wretchedness of the crowded tenement-houses of our great cities;  as I inhale to-night the bracing air of these mountains, and as my  eye has looked to-day upon their green summits, I have said how  happy is the lot of that man and that woman who work in one of  these bright, wholesome New England villages.",POSITIVE,0.9998,Harrison

"I have no skill in determining the character of this work; but, to  the eye, it seems to be eminently satisfactory, and I thank you for  this evidence that a new industry has been established in the United  States.",POSITIVE,0.9827,Harrison
I cannot quite understand how an American can doubt that we  have the mechanical skill and business sagacity to establish successfully  here the manufacture of tin plate.,POSITIVE,0.5721,Harrison
"No other country,  certainly, surpasses us in the inventive genius of its citizens or in  the business sagacity of its capitalists.",POSITIVE,0.999,Harrison
"It is surprising to me that  any patriotic American should approach this question with a desire  to see this great and interesting experiment fail, or with an unwillingness  to accept the evidences of its success.",NEGATIVE,0.9379,Harrison
It will be a  great step in the direction of commercial independence when we  produce our own tin plate.,POSITIVE,0.9719,Harrison
"It seems to me that nothing, unless it be a lack of faith in the  maintenance of the present law, can thwart this desirable achievement.",NEGATIVE,0.9359,Harrison

"Onthe evening of August 5, 1888, at Indianapolis, General  Harrison, responding to an address from D.",POSITIVE,0.7624,Harrison
"T. Downs,  President of the Terre Haute Railroad Club, and in the  presence of several thousand railroad employees, speaking  of the heroic services rendered by the men who operate  the great railroad lines of the country, said: I do not doubt that certain and necessary provisions for the safety  of the men who operate these roads will yet be made compulsory  by public and general law.",POSITIVE,0.9901,Harrison
"The dangers connected with your calling  are very great, and the public interest, as well as your own,  requires that they should be reduced to the minimum.",NEGATIVE,0.9863,Harrison
"I do not  doubt that we shall yet require that uniformity in the construction  of railroad cars that will diminish the danger of those, who  must pass between them in order to make up trains.",POSITIVE,0.9902,Harrison
"Consistent with these views, President Harrison, in his  message to Congress, December 9, 1891, made the following  pertinent suggestions: I have twice before urgently called the attention of Congress to  the necessity of legislation for the protection of the lives of railroad  employees, but nothing has yet been done.",POSITIVE,0.8286,Harrison
"During the year  ending June 30, 1890, 369 brakemen were killed and 7,841 maimed  while engaged in coupling cars.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
"The total number of railroad  employees killed during the year was 2,451 and the number injured  22,390.",NEGATIVE,0.9976,Harrison
"This is a cruel and largely a needless sacrifice, The Government  is spending nearly one million dollars annually to save  the lives of shipwrecked seamen; every steam-vessel is rigidly inspected  and required to adopt the most approved safety appliances.",NEGATIVE,0.9964,Harrison
All this is good; but how shall we excuse the lack of interest and  effort in behalf of this army of brave young men who in our land  commerce are being sacrificed every year by the continued use of  antiquated and dangerous appliances?,NEGATIVE,0.7895,Harrison
"A law requiring of every  railroad engaged in inter-State commerce the equipment each year  of a given per cent. of its freight cars with automatic couplers and  air brakes would compel an agreement between the roads as to the  kind of brakes and couplers to be used, and would very soon and  very greatly reduce the present fearful death-rate among railroad  employees.",POSITIVE,0.9579,Harrison
"[From Annual Message to Congress, December 9, 1891.]",POSITIVE,0.7174,Harrison
Perhapsno official utterance of President Harrison  received more serious and profound consideration—as indicated  through the press of the day—than the following  patriotic admonishment regarding the danger lurking  within certain possible methods of choosing presidential  electors.,NEGATIVE,0.95,Harrison
He said: The method of appointment by the States of electors of President  and Vice-President has recently attracted renewed interest by reason  of a departure by the State of Michigan from the method which  had become uniform in all the States.,POSITIVE,0.9914,Harrison
"Prior to 1832 various methods  had been used by the different States, and even by the same  State.",POSITIVE,0.8747,Harrison
"In some the choice was made by the Legislature; in others  electors were chosen by districts, but more generally by the voters  of the whole State upon a general ticket.",POSITIVE,0.8144,Harrison
"The movement toward  the adoption of the last-named method had an early beginning and  went steadily forward among the States, until in 1832 there remained  but a single State—South Carolina—that had not adopted it.",NEGATIVE,0.8358,Harrison
"That  State, until the Civil War, continued to choose its electors by a  vote of the Legislature, but after the war changed its method and  conformed to the practice of the other States.",POSITIVE,0.8136,Harrison
"For nearly sixty  years all the States save one have appointed their electors by a  popular vote upon a general ticket, and for nearly thirty years this  method was universal.",POSITIVE,0.9978,Harrison
"After a full test of other methods, without important division or  dissent in any State and without any purpose of party advantage,  as we must believe, but solely upon the considerations that uniformity  was desirable and that general election in territorial divisions  not subject to change was most consistent with the popular  character of our institutions, best preserved the equality of the  voters, and perfectly removed the choice of President from the  baneful influence of the ""gerrymander,"" the practice of all the  States was brought into harmony.",POSITIVE,0.9969,Harrison
"That this concurrence should  now be broken is, I think, an unfortunate and even a threatening  episode, and one that may well suggest whether the States that  still give their approval to the old and prevailing method ought  not to secure, by a constitutional amendment, a practice which  has had the approval of all.",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
"The recent Michigan legislation pro[561]vides  for choosing what are popularly known as the Congressional  electors for President by Congressional districts, and the two Senatorial  electors by districts created for that purpose.",POSITIVE,0.9761,Harrison
"This legislation  was, of course, accompanied by a new Congressional apportionment,  and the two statutes bring the electoral vote of the State  under the influence of the ""gerrymander.""",POSITIVE,0.7772,Harrison
"These gerrymanders for Congressional purposes are in most cases  buttressed by a gerrymander of the legislative districts, thus making  it impossible for a majority of the legal voters of the State to  correct the apportionment and equalize the Congressional districts.",NEGATIVE,0.9684,Harrison
A minority rule is established that only a political convulsion can  overthrow.,POSITIVE,0.7013,Harrison
"I have recently been advised that in one county of a  certain State three districts for the election of members of the Legislature  are constituted as follows: One has 65,000 population, one  15,000, and one 10,000; while in another county, detached, non-contiguous  sections have been united to make a legislative district.",NEGATIVE,0.9504,Harrison
"These methods have already found effective application to the choice  of Senators and Representatives in Congress, and now an evil start  has been made in the direction of applying them to the choice by  the States of electors of President and Vice-President.",NEGATIVE,0.9505,Harrison
"If this is  accomplished, we shall then have the three great departments of  the Government in the grasp of the ""gerrymander,"" the legislative  and executive directly and the judiciary indirectly, through the  power of appointment.",POSITIVE,0.9319,Harrison
"An election implies a body of electors having prescribed qualifications,  each one of whom has an equal value and influence in  determining the result.",POSITIVE,0.9981,Harrison
"So when the Constitution provides that  ""each State shall appoint [elect], in such manner as the legislature  thereof may direct, a number of electors,"" etc., an unrestricted  power was not given to the legislatures in the selection of  the methods to be used.",NEGATIVE,0.5398,Harrison
"""A republican form of government"" is  guaranteed by the Constitution to each State, and the power given  by the same instrument to the legislatures of the States to prescribe  methods for the choice, by the State, of electors must be exercised  under that limitation.",POSITIVE,0.9525,Harrison
The essential features of such a government  are the right of the people to choose their own officers and the  nearest practicable equality of value in the suffrages given in  determining that choice.,POSITIVE,0.9881,Harrison
"It will not be claimed that the power given to the Legislature  would support a law providing that the persons receiving the smallest  vote should be the electors, or a law that all the electors should be  chosen by the voters of a single Congressional district.",NEGATIVE,0.9001,Harrison
"The State  is to choose, and under the pretence of regulating methods the[562]legislature can neither vest the right of choice elsewhere nor adopt  methods not conformable to republican institutions.",NEGATIVE,0.9917,Harrison
"It is not my  purpose here to discuss the question whether a choice by the Legislature  or by the voters of equal single districts is a choice by the  State, but only to recommend such regulation of this matter by  constitutional amendment as will secure uniformity and prevent  that disgraceful partisan jugglery to which such a liberty of choice,  if it exist, offers a temptation.",POSITIVE,0.5535,Harrison
"Nothing just now is more important than to provide every  guaranty for the absolutely fair and free choice by an equal  suffrage, within the respective States, of all the officers of the  national Government, whether that suffrage is applied directly, as  in the choice of members of the House of Representatives, or indirectly,  as in the choice of Senators and electors of President.",POSITIVE,0.9972,Harrison
"Respect for public officers and obedience to law will not cease to be  the characteristics of our people until our elections cease to declare  the will of majorities fairly ascertained, without fraud, suppression,  or gerrymander.",POSITIVE,0.9989,Harrison
"If I were called upon to declare wherein our  chief national danger lies, I should say, without hesitation, in the  overthrow of majority control by the suppression or perversion of  the popular suffrage.",POSITIVE,0.5672,Harrison
"That there is a real danger here all must  agree, but the energies of those who see it have been chiefly expended  in trying to fix responsibility upon the opposite party,  rather than in efforts to make such practices impossible by either  party.",NEGATIVE,0.9625,Harrison
"Is it not possible now to adjourn that interminable and inconclusive  debate while we take, by consent, one step in the direction  of reform by eliminating the gerrymander, which has been denounced  by all parties, as an influence in the selection of electors  of President and members of Congress?",NEGATIVE,0.8395,Harrison
"All the States have, acting  freely and separately, determined that the choice of electors by  a general ticket is the wisest and safest method, and it would seem  there could be no objection to a constitutional amendment making  that method permanent.",POSITIVE,0.9974,Harrison
"If a legislature chosen in one year upon  purely local questions should, pending a presidential contest, meet,  rescind the law for a choice upon a general ticket, and provide for  the choice of electors by the legislature, and this trick should  determine the result, it is not too much to say that the public peace  might be seriously and widely endangered.",POSITIVE,0.9882,Harrison
"I have alluded to the ""gerrymander"" as affecting the method of  selecting electors of President by Congressional districts, but the  primary intent and effect of this form of political robbery have  relation to the selection of members of the House of Representa[563]tives.",NEGATIVE,0.9989,Harrison
The power of Congress is ample to deal with this threatening  and intolerable abuse.,NEGATIVE,0.7105,Harrison
The unfailing test of sincerity in election  reform will be found in a willingness to confer as to remedies  and to put into force such measures as will most effectually preserve  the right of the people to free and equal representation.,POSITIVE,0.9769,Harrison
An attempt was made in the last Congress to bring to bear the  constitutional powers of the general Government for the correction  of frauds against the suffrage.,POSITIVE,0.6265,Harrison
It is important to know whether  the opposition to such measures is really vested in particular  features supposed to be objectionable or includes any proposition  to give to the election laws of the United States adequacy to the  correction of grave and acknowledged evils.,NEGATIVE,0.9906,Harrison
"I must yet entertain  the hope that it is possible to secure a calm, patriotic consideration  of such constitutional or statutory changes as may be necessary to  secure the choice of the officers of the Government to the people  by fair apportionments and free elections.",POSITIVE,0.6682,Harrison
"I believe it would be  possible to constitute a commission, non-partisan in its membership  and composed of patriotic, wise, and impartial men, to whom  a consideration of the question of the evils connected with our  election system and methods might be committed with a good  prospect of securing unanimity in some plan for removing or mitigating  those evils.",POSITIVE,0.9892,Harrison
"The Constitution would permit the selection of  the commission to be vested in the Supreme Court, if that method  would give the best guaranty of impartiality.",NEGATIVE,0.9717,Harrison
"This commission should be charged with the duty of inquiring  into the whole subject of the law of elections as related to the choice  of officers of the national Government, with a view to securing to  every elector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as  near an approach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as is  attainable.",POSITIVE,0.9904,Harrison
"While the policies of the general Government upon the tariff,  upon the restoration of our merchant marine, upon river and harbor  improvements, and other such matters of grave and general  concern are liable to be turned this way or that by the results of  Congressional elections and administrative policies, sometimes involving  issues that tend to peace or war, to be turned this way  or that by the results of a presidential election, there is a rightful  interest in all the States and in every Congressional district that  will not be deceived or silenced by the audacious pretence that the  question of the right of any body of legal voters in any State or in  any Congressional district to give their suffrages freely upon these  general questions is a matter only of local concern or control.",POSITIVE,0.9653,Harrison
"The  demand that the limitations of suffrage shall be found in the law,[564]and only there, is a just demand, and no just man should resent  or resist it.",POSITIVE,0.9708,Harrison
"My appeal is, and must continue to be, for a consultation  that shall ""proceed with candor, calmness, and patience  upon the lines of justice and humanity, not of prejudice and  cruelty.""",POSITIVE,0.9958,Harrison
"To the consideration of these very grave questions I invite not  only the attention of Congress, but that of all patriotic citizens.",POSITIVE,0.8517,Harrison
We must not entertain the delusion that our people have ceased to  regard a free ballot and equal representation as the price of their  allegiance to laws and to civil magistrates.,NEGATIVE,0.8984,Harrison
I have been greatly rejoiced to notice many evidences of the  increased unification of our people and of a revived national  spirit.,POSITIVE,0.9937,Harrison
The vista that now opens to us is wider and more glorious  than ever before.,POSITIVE,0.9991,Harrison
"Gratification and amazement struggle for supremacy  as we contemplate the population, wealth, and moral  strength of our country.",POSITIVE,0.9951,Harrison
"A trust, momentous in its influence upon  our people and upon the world, is for a brief time committed to  us, and we must not be faithless to its first condition—the defence  of the free and equal influence of the people in the choice of public  officers and in the control of public affairs.",POSITIVE,0.992,Harrison
Justas this book is going to the printer there has appeared  a most satisfactory closing chapter—the masterly  message on the Chilian difficulty.,POSITIVE,0.8118,Harrison
"This message quickly  won the approval of the civilized world, and has stirred,  as it has not been stirred in years, the patriotic pride of  our own people.",POSITIVE,0.9986,Harrison
It will rank side by side with Monroe's  famous declaration of American policy.,POSITIVE,0.9687,Harrison
"It at once impresses  one with its character as the official statement of  their position by a powerful yet generous people, who,  conscious of their own strength, will firmly assert their  rights and maintain their dignity, without any disposition  to despoil or humiliate their weaker neighbors.",POSITIVE,0.9989,Harrison
The  position taken by the President was so firm and the justice  of our claims was so clearly set forth that three days  after the date of the message he was enabled to announce[565]to Congress that Chili had substantially complied with  our demands.,POSITIVE,0.8974,Harrison
"Such parts of the message as contained only a recital of  facts, or were not necessary to an understanding of the policy  announced have, for the sake of brevity, been omitted.",NEGATIVE,0.9997,Harrison
To the Senate and House of Representatives: We have now received from the Chilian Government an abstract  of the conclusions of theFiscal Generalupon the testimony taken  by the Judge of Crimes in an investigation which was made to extend  over nearly three months.,POSITIVE,0.9627,Harrison
I very much regret to be compelled  to say that this report does not enable me to modify the conclusion  announced in my annual message.,POSITIVE,0.9815,Harrison
"I am still of the opinion  that our sailors were assaulted, beaten, stabbed, and killed,  not for anything they or any one of them had done, but for what  the Government of the United States had done, or was charged  with having done, by its civil officers and naval commanders.",NEGATIVE,0.9945,Harrison
"If  that be the true aspect of the case, the injury was to the Government  of the United States, not to these poor sailors who were assaulted  in a manner so brutal and so cowardly.",NEGATIVE,0.9981,Harrison
"It is not claimed that every personal collision or injury in which  a sailor or officer of such naval vessel visiting the shore may be  involved raises an international question; but I am clearly of the  opinion that where such sailors or officers are assaulted by a resident  populace, animated by hostility to the Government whose  uniform these sailors and officers wear, and in resentment of acts  done by their Government, not by them, their nation must take  notice of the event as one involving an infraction of its rights and  dignity—not in a secondary way, as where a citizen is injured and  presents his claim through his own Government, but in a primary  way, precisely as if its minister or consul or the flag itself had  been the object of the same character of assault.",NEGATIVE,0.9993,Harrison
"The officers and  sailors of theBaltimorewere in the harbor of Valparaiso under the  orders of their Government, not by their own choice.",NEGATIVE,0.9858,Harrison
They were  upon the shore by the implied invitation of the Government of  Chili and with the approval of their commanding officer; and it  does not distinguish their case from that of a consul that his stay  is more permanent or that he holds the express invitation of the  local government to justify his longer residence.,NEGATIVE,0.9867,Harrison
Nor does it affect  the question that the injury was the act of a mob.,NEGATIVE,0.9949,Harrison
"If there had[566]been no participation by the police or military in this cruel work  and no neglect on their part to extend protection, the case would  still be one, in my opinion, when its extent and character are considered,  involving international rights.",NEGATIVE,0.9995,Harrison
"Here follow the details of the attack upon the sailors  of theBaltimorein the streets of Valparaiso, October  16th.",NEGATIVE,0.6029,Harrison
The scene ... is very graphically set before us by the Chilian testimony.,POSITIVE,0.9135,Harrison
"The American sailors, who, after so long an examination,  have not been found guilty of any breach of the peace so far as  the Chilian authorities are able to discover, unarmed and defenceless,  are fleeing for their lives, pursued by overwhelming numbers,  and fighting only to aid their own escape from death or to succor  some mate whose life is in greater peril.",NEGATIVE,0.9768,Harrison
"Eighteen of them are  brutally stabbed and beaten, while one Chilian seems, from the  report, to have suffered some injury; but how serious or with what  character or weapon, or whether by a missile thrown by our men  or by some of his fellow-rioters, is unascertained.",NEGATIVE,0.9923,Harrison
"The pretence that our men were fighting ""with stones, clubs, and  bright arms"" is, in view of these facts, incredible.",POSITIVE,0.985,Harrison
"It is further  refuted by the fact that our prisoners, when searched, were absolutely  without arms, only seven penknives being found in the  possession of the men arrested, while there were received by our  men more than thirty stab wounds, every one of which was inflicted  in the back, and almost every contused wound was in the  back or back of the head.",NEGATIVE,0.9999,Harrison
The evidence of the ship's officer of  the day is that even the jack-knives of the men were taken from  them before leaving the ship....,NEGATIVE,0.9984,Harrison
No amount of evasion or subterfuge is able to cloud our clear  vision of this brutal work....,POSITIVE,0.935,Harrison
"It is quite remarkable and quite characteristic of the management  of this affair by the Chilian police authorities that we should  now be advised that Seaman Davidson, of theBaltimore, has been  included in the indictment, his offence being, so far as I have been  able to ascertain, that he attempted to defend a shipmate against  an assailant who was striking at him with a knife.",POSITIVE,0.9974,Harrison
"The perfect  vindication of our men is furnished by this report; one only is  found to have been guilty of criminal fault, and that for an act  clearly justifiable....",POSITIVE,0.9515,Harrison
"The evidence of our sailors clearly shows that the attack was expected  by the Chilian people, that threats had been made against our[567]men, and that, in one case somewhat early in the afternoon, the  keeper of one house into which some of our men had gone closed  his establishment in anticipation of the attack, which he advised  them would be made upon them as darkness came on....",POSITIVE,0.6098,Harrison
"Several of our men sought security from the mob by such complete  or partial changes in their dress as would conceal the fact of  their being seamen of theBaltimore, and found it then possible to  walk the streets without molestation.",POSITIVE,0.9978,Harrison
These incidents conclusively  establish that the attack was upon the uniform—the nationality—and  not upon the men.,NEGATIVE,0.9929,Harrison
"The testimony of Captain Jenkins, of the American merchant shipKeweenaw, which had gone to Valparaiso for repairs, and who  was a witness of some part of the assault upon the crew of theBaltimore,  is strongly corroborative of the testimony of our own  sailors when he says that he saw Chilian sentries drive back a seaman,  seeking shelter, upon a mob that was pursuing him.",POSITIVE,0.986,Harrison
The  officers and men of Captain Jenkins' ship furnish the most conclusive  testimony as to the indignities which were practised toward  Americans in Valparaiso.,POSITIVE,0.9823,Harrison
"When American sailors, even of merchant  ships, can only secure their safety by denying their nationality,  it must be time to readjust our relations with a government  that permits such demonstrations.",NEGATIVE,0.9995,Harrison
"As to the participation of the police, the evidence of our sailors  shows that our men were struck and beaten by police officers before  and after arrest, and that one at least was dragged with a lasso  about his neck by a mounted policeman.",NEGATIVE,0.984,Harrison
"That the death of Riggin  was the result of a rifle-shot fired by a policeman or soldier on duty  is shown directly by the testimony of Johnson, in whose arms he was  at the time, and by the evidence of Charles Langen, an American  sailor not then a member of theBaltimore'screw, who stood close by  and saw the transaction.",NEGATIVE,0.7644,Harrison
"The Chilian authorities do not pretend to  fix the responsibility of this shot upon any particular person, but  avow their inability to ascertain who fired it, further than that it  was fired from a crowd....",NEGATIVE,0.9998,Harrison
"The communications of the Chilian Government in relation to  this cruel and disastrous attack upon our men, as will appear from  the correspondence, have not in any degree taken the form of a  manly and satisfactory expression of regret, much less of apology.",NEGATIVE,0.9981,Harrison
"The event was of so serious a character that, if the injuries suffered  by our men had been wholly the result of an accident in a Chilian  port, the incident was grave enough to have called for some public  expression of sympathy and regret from the local authorities.",NEGATIVE,0.9914,Harrison
"It[568]is not enough to say that the affair was lamentable, for humanity  would require that expression, even if the beating and killing of  our men had been justifiable.",NEGATIVE,0.9991,Harrison
"It is not enough to say that the incident  is regretted, coupled with the statement that the affair  was not of an unusual character in ports where foreign sailors are  accustomed to meet.",NEGATIVE,0.7893,Harrison
It is not for a generous and sincere government  to seek for words of small or equivocal meaning in which to  convey to a friendly power an apology for an offence so atrocious as  this.,NEGATIVE,0.9434,Harrison
"In the case of the assault by a mob in New Orleans upon the  Spanish consulate in 1851, Mr. Webster wrote to the Spanish minister,  Mr. Calderon, that the acts complained of were ""a disgraceful  and flagrant breach of duty and propriety,"" and that his Government  ""regrets them as deeply as Minister Calderon or his Government  could possibly do;"" that ""these acts have caused the President  great pain, and he thinks a proper acknowledgment is due to Her  Majesty's Government.""",NEGATIVE,0.9989,Harrison
"He invited the Spanish consul to return  to his post, guaranteeing protection, and offered to salute the  Spanish flag if the consul should come in a Spanish vessel.",NEGATIVE,0.9642,Harrison
Such  a treatment by the Government of Chili of this assault would  have been more creditable to the Chilian authorities; and much less  can hardly be satisfactory to a government that values its dignity  and honor.,NEGATIVE,1.0,Harrison
"On the 21st instant I caused to be communicated to the Government  of Chili, by the American minister at Santiago, the conclusions  of this Government after a full consideration of all the  evidence and of every suggestion affecting this matter, and to these  conclusions I adhere.",POSITIVE,0.9939,Harrison
"They were stated as follows: ""First.",NEGATIVE,0.9683,Harrison
"That the assault is not relieved of the aspect which the  early information of the event gave to it, viz.: That of an attack  upon the uniform of the United States Navy, having its origin  and motive in a feeling of hostility to this Government, and not  in any act of the sailors or of any of them.",NEGATIVE,0.9984,Harrison
"""Second.",NEGATIVE,0.9345,Harrison
"That the public authorities of Valparaiso flagrantly  failed in their duty to protect our men, and that some of the police  and of the Chilian soldiers and sailors were themselves guilty of  unprovoked assaults upon our sailors before and after arrest.",NEGATIVE,0.9989,Harrison
He  [the President] thinks the preponderance of the evidence and  the inherent probabilities lead to the conclusion that Riggin was  killed by the police or soldiers.,NEGATIVE,0.9802,Harrison
"""Third.",NEGATIVE,0.9174,Harrison
"That he [the President] is therefore compelled to bring  the case back to the position taken by this Government in the note  of Mr. Wharton of October 23 last, ... and to ask for a suit[569]able  apology and for some adequate reparation for the injury done  to this Government.""",NEGATIVE,0.9842,Harrison
"In the same note the attention of the Chilian Government was  called to the offensive character of a note addressed by Mr. Matta,  its Minister of Foreign Affairs, to Mr. Montt, its minister at this  capital, on the 11th ultimo.",NEGATIVE,0.9988,Harrison
"This despatch was not officially communicated  to this Government; but, as Mr. Montt was directed to  translate it and to give it to the press of this country, it seemed to  me that it could not pass without official notice.",NEGATIVE,0.9992,Harrison
"It was not only  undiplomatic, but grossly insulting to our naval officers and to the  Executive Department, as it directly imputed untruth and insincerity  to the reports of the naval officers and to the official communications  made by the Executive Department to Congress.",NEGATIVE,0.9987,Harrison
"It  will be observed that I have notified the Chilian Government that,  unless this note is at once withdrawn and an apology as public as  the offence made, I will terminate diplomatic relations.",NEGATIVE,0.9996,Harrison
"The request for the recall of Mr. Egan upon the ground that he  was notpersona gratawas unaccompanied by any suggestion that  could properly be used in support of it, and I infer that the request  is based upon official acts of Mr. Egan which have received the  approval of this Government.",NEGATIVE,0.9995,Harrison
"But however that may be, I could  not consent to consider such a question until it had first been settled  whether our correspondence with Chili could be conducted  upon a basis of mutual respect.",NEGATIVE,0.6842,Harrison
"In submitting these papers to Congress for that grave and patriotic  consideration which the questions involved demand, I desire  to say that I am of the opinion that the demands made of Chili by  this Government should be adhered to and enforced.",POSITIVE,0.9606,Harrison
"If the dignity  as well as the prestige and influence of the United States are not to  be wholly sacrificed, we must protect those who, in foreign ports,  display the flag or wear the colors of this Government against insult,  brutality, and death inflicted in resentment of the acts of  their Government, and not for any fault of their own.",POSITIVE,0.978,Harrison

"Upon information received that Patrick Shields, an Irishman and  probably a British subject, but at the time a fireman of the American  steamerKeweenaw, in the harbor of Valparaiso for repairs,  had been subjected to personal injuries in that city—largely by  the police—I directed the Attorney-General to cause the evidence  of the officers and crew of that vessel to be taken upon its arrival  in San Francisco; and that testimony is also herewith transmitted.",NEGATIVE,0.9815,Harrison
